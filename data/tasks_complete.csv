Something about the orientation of faith being your identity marker as opposed to nationality or ethnicity. Post-9/11, that is an issue: folks get labeled ""Muslim"" no matter where they're from. If you are Muslim, then that is part of it, but here's the complicating factor for me: growing up, the only part of my identity that mattered was being Muslim, and I knew that. Being Pakistani was not as important as being Muslim. So the black guy whom I met who's a Muslim, I'm much closer to him than the Christian Pakistani guy who is my dad's friend. We have a closer bond. This was innate[2] to me as a kid. I don't know what it's like to be Jewish, but I suspect there is some aspect of that: being Jewish is the thing that bonds you as opposed to being Jewish from Poland, or Jewish from Hungary [...]."" Write a letter to the editor of Guernica Magazine telling them that you have just read Disgraced in school and how you think about faith being one's main identity marker, as Akhtar calls it. Make references to Amir in the play but also include your own opinion, from your perspective of a student growing up in Germany.
