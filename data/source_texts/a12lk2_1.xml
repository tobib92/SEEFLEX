      <p>Extract from Act I scene 2 from William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'</p>

    <body>
      <u who="#A">My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound: Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</u>
      <u who="#B">Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike?</u>
      <u who="#A">How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</u>
      <u who="#B">With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.</u>
      <u who="#A">If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</u>
      <u who="#B">Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.</u>
      <u who="#A">I would not for the world they saw thee here.</u>
      <u who="#B">I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight; And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</u>
      <u who="#A">By whose direction found'st thou out this place?</u>
      <u who="#B">By love, who first did prompt me to inquire; He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, I would adventure for such merchandise.</u>
      <u who="#A">Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain, deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light: But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange, I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, My true love's passion: therefore pardon me, And not impute this yielding to light love, Which the dark night hath so discovered.</u>
      <u who="#B">Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops ---</u>
      <u who="#A">O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</u>
      <u who="#B">What shall I swear by?</u>
      <u who="#A">Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'II believe thee.</u>
