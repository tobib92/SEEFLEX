        <s>I think <name type="misc"><choice><orig>Akhtar</orig><reg>Akhtar's</reg></choice></name> view of faith is quite interesting and <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> think he made a good job to <choice><orig>bing</orig><reg>bring</reg></choice> his message over through his novel.</s>
        <s>We can see on the main character <name type="misc">Amir</name>.</s>
        <s>Because <name type="misc">Amir</name> is a Pakistani which isn't even Muslim, and distant himself from the religion, furthermore, despise it, he is and will ever be treated as a muslim because of his look and the country he was born at.</s>
        <s>As <name type="misc">Akhtar</name> said in the interview <name type="misc">Amir</name> got labeled as muslim based on his look.</s>
        <s>As <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> German student <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> had the same point of view and make the same mistake everytime <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> see somebody outside which looks South-Asian or speaks <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> <choice><orig>arebic</orig><reg>Arabic</reg></choice> language <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> assume he is muslim.</s>
