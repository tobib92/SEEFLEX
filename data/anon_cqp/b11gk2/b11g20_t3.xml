        <salute>Dear editor of the <name type="misc">Guernica Magazine</name>,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I am writing to you in response to the interview with <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> which has only recently been published in <name type="misc">Guernica Magazine</name>.</s>
        <s>I read <name type="misc">Disgraced</name> at school and I think that faith is a big part of one's identity.</s>
        <s>In the play <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> spits in a Jewish <choice><orig>girl</orig><reg>girl's</reg></choice> face just because his mother spat in his face for having a crush on a Jewish girl.</s>
        <s>In scene 3 <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> spits during an <choice><orig>Argument</orig><reg>argument</reg></choice> in the face of his Jewish <choice><orig>Friend</orig><reg>friend</reg></choice> <name type="misc">Isaac</name>, but he doesn't even is Jewish anymore <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 52, l. 31-33)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This shows <choice><orig>one</orig><reg>on</reg></choice> the one hand that you never can get rid of your religion but also not of your prejudices.</s>
        <s>In my opinion you can get rid of your faith but not of the cultural habits that lead to a religion.</s>
        <s>I also think that one never can get rid of prejudices against ones.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the <choice><orig>Interview</orig><reg>interview</reg></choice> <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> says that religion is more <choice><orig>importand</orig><reg>important</reg></choice> than what country you come from, but in my opinion it is the other way around.</s>
        <s>For me <choice><orig>Religion</orig><reg>religion</reg></choice> is something you can hide very well your faith is forced inside you and influences your actions from there.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>You</orig><reg>Your</reg></choice> origin, on the other hand, is recognisable at first glance by external characteristics and since prejudices relate to the first image of a person, you cannot get rid of them.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope you can understand my point of view and found my letter interesting.</s>
