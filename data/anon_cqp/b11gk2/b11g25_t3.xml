        <salute>Dear Sir or Madam,</salute>

        <s>I am writing to you in response to the interview with <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> which has only recently been published in <name type="misc">Guernica Magazine</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I want to talk about the sentence of <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> where he says: <quote>faith being one's main identity marker</quote>.</s>
        <s>I think there is a lot of trueness in this sentence.</s>
        <s>In this generation, being faithful expresses much more than it did a few years ago, just because there are many people that are not faithful anymore.</s>
        <s>In the early <date>18th century</date>, religion was a way to life.</s>
        <s>It was more than just a decision.</s>
        <s>Almost everyone was faithful and people who were not, were a shame.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The new perspectives on <choice><orig>bioligy</orig><reg>biology</reg></choice>, chemistry and physics changed the way to look at religion completely.</s>
        <s>Now it was proven, that the human being comes from the monkey by evolution - not by a god who created them.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Religion gets much less and is harder to find but if you find someone who is true faithful, it is still different.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Thank you for the interview with <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name>, it was very interesting.</s>
