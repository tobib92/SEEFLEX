        <s>In the following I want to analyze in what way this excerpt can be considered the turning point of the play and which previous events and conflicts finally lead to <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir's</ref> emotional outburst.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The excerpt can be considered the turning point because it makes clear that Islam is still part of <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref>.</s>
        <s>He spits in <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac's</ref> face <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 72, l. 40)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The author wants to point out that after all this time, in which <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> tried to give up his religion, the influence his mother had, when he was a child, still has an impact on him.</s>
        <s>When <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> was a child his mother spat in his face, when he told her that he likes <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> <choice><orig>jewish</orig><reg>Jewish</reg></choice> girl.</s>
        <s>When <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> saw this girl again he spat in her face too.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>A further point is that <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> hit <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> multiple times in the face <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(<choice><orig>compar</orig><reg>compare</reg></choice> p. 74, ll. 5-14)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In an earlier scene <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> tells <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref>, <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref> and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> that the <choice><orig>Koran</orig><reg>Quran</reg></choice> says: <quote><qs>Men are in charge of woman... if they don't obey... talk to them.</qs><qs>If that [does not] work... [Do not] sleep with them.</qs><qs>And if that [does not] work beat them</qs></quote> <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 64, ll. 12-18)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The author again wants to tell us that the Islam still has an impact on <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref>.</s>
        <s>But not only the fact that <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> has an affair with <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> <choice><orig>lead</orig><reg>leads</reg></choice> to <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir's</ref> emotional outburst.</s>
        <s><ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> couldn't understand why <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> <choice><orig>want</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> to give up his religion.</s>
        <s>She could not understand why <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> does not want to be seen with the Iman.</s>
        <s>They always discussed about this topic.</s>
        <s><ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> followed the order how to deal with <choice><orig>woman</orig><reg>women</reg></choice>, who <choice><orig>does</orig><reg>do</reg></choice> not obey, probably deliberate.</s>
        <s>First he talked with <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref>, secondly he did not sleep with her and at the end he hit <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> in her face.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Another conflict that <choice><orig>lead</orig><reg>leads</reg></choice> to his outburst is the promotion he did not get because the media made him look like the attorney of <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> terrorist.</s>
        <s><ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> convinced him to go to the hearing.</s>
        <s>This made his office check his document.</s>
        <s>He thinks this is also the reason why <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref> was promoted.</s>
        <s>In the given excerpt the author also points out that <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> was angry with <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref> about not telling him about her promotion <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 71, ll. 23-25)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To sum it up the anger and disappointment pent up for quite a while and the affair between <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> only was a final trigger for <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir's</ref> emotional outburst.</s>
