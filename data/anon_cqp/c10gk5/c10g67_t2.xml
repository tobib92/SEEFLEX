      <p>
        <s>By structuring certain sections i.e. informative <ref target="c10gk5_1" type="line">(l. 1-10)</ref>, argumentative <ref target="c10gk5_1" type="line">(l. 11-17)</ref> and appealing <ref target="c10gk5_1" type="line">(l. 18-23)</ref>, the author succeeds in stimulating the reader.</s>
        <s>This <choice><orig>structur</orig><reg>structure</reg></choice> makes sense, hence the target group, who are the people, who read the <name type="misc">Sunday Times</name>, citizens in <name type="geo"><choice><abbr>GB</abbr><expan>Great Britain</expan></choice></name>, is interest in reading this article, by put the informative part first and the appealing in the end to convince the reader to do something.</s>

        <s>This anaphora he uses is supposed to give the target group emphasis and to convince the reader of his past about this theme/topic.</s>

        <s><quote>[...] stand on your own two feet if someone is holding you up</quote><ref target="c10gk5_1" type="line">(l. 18-19)</ref>, this metaphor, which is there to create a picture in the reader's mind, succeeds <ref target="c10gk5_1" type="author">Zia</ref>, provided he uses this not just for specification.</s>
      </p>
      <p>

        <s>The last stylistic device, I would like to mention is the <choice><orig>repitition</orig><reg>repetition</reg></choice> of a <q>we-feeling</q>, <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> well chosen, in order to include the reader.</s>
        <s>This is shown e.g. in line <ref target="c10gk5_1" type="line">(18, 23, 20, ...)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Another point is the use of a convincing figure <quote>more than Â£100<choice><abbr>m</abbr><expan>million</expan></choice> [...]</quote> <ref target="c10gk5_1" type="line">(l. 1)</ref>, which gives the reader a feeling of a professional work, the author uses here.</s>
