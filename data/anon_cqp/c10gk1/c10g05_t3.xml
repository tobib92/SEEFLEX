        <s>Of course, the world doesn't break down as soon as you cross a language border, but your experience does.</s>
        <s>How should one be able to make new experiences when he can't speak the language?</s>
        <s>You can't.</s>
        <s>Maybe one time, just not being able to talk is a new experience.</s>
        <s>But then, it just repreats.</s>
        <s>A world without communication is boring, and it is the same everywhere, just you and yourself.</s>
        <s>The world is full of people, sounds and colours, if you can speak with them.</s>
        <s>If not, everywhere it is the same - you are outside your world.</s>
