        <s>After that <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> makes his point of view very clear, as he disagrees with sayings of others in regard of importance of foreign languages and the development of technology as a reason not to learn them.</s>
        <s>Moreover he talks about globalization and how useful foreign languages are, especially as criteria for a job.</s>
