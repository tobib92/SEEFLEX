      <p>
        <s>The author tells the number of students in the <name type="geo">UK</name> which choose to study an other language than <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> goes significantly down <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 3-5)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Also the uptake of languages are stopped <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 7-8)</ref> and fewer language <name type="misc">A-level</name> exams are taken then in <date>1990</date> <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 9-12)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the <choice><orig>authors</orig><reg>author's</reg></choice> opinion this is a huge problem because on the one hand not everybody in the world can speak <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 12-15)</ref> and on the other hand you need more than one language to be <choice><orig>successfull</orig><reg>successful</reg></choice> in the future <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 19-23; ll. 27-29)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Admittedly there are some progress like that students should start to learn an other language in primary school <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 6-7)</ref> or that  universities offer students to study a language besides their degree subject <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 24-26)</ref> but more people should learn another language to safe their future <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 30-31)</ref> and their parents should help to do something for it <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 32-35)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In short the author thinks that in the <name type="geo">UK</name> too little young people speak a second language.</s>
        <s>So he wants to expand the language learning in schools and universities with the help from other parents because the education system <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> fix this alone.</s>
