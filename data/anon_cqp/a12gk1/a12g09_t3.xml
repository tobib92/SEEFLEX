        <s>And so it is very important to learn languages, because it is vital for the <name type="geo">UK</name> future.</s>

        <s>To save <name type="geo">UK's</name> future <choice><orig>properity</orig><reg>prosperity</reg></choice> and global standing, they have to be people that study foreign language.</s>
        <s>Of course there are people that claim that these cultural exchange might be a loss of identity, but in real life it is a big opportunity to connect the whole world.</s>
