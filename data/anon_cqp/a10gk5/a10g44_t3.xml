        <s>In my opinion the pollution of the world is a fault which was made by us, only because we want to have the newest car or the best phone.</s>
        <s>We have to cancel this race about who is the strongest country, who makes the most cash with the industrial growth.</s>

        <s>The people need to regulate their own things, then we are one step closer to clear the world up from <choice><orig>pollute</orig><reg>pollution</reg></choice> and <choice><orig>Contamination</orig><reg>contamination</reg></choice>.</s>
