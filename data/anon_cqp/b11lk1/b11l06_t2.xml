        <s>In the beginning of the excerpt the narrator gives a reported thought of <name type="person">Delaney</name> <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(ll. 1-2)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The narrator shows the reader that <name type="person">Delaney</name> is under influence of his friend <name type="person">Jack</name> and wife <name type="person">Kyra</name>.</s>
        <s>He thinks <quote>stand up for what he believed in</quote> right after he mentioned <name type="person">Jack</name> and <name type="person">Kyra</name>, this could be a sign that <name type="person">Delaney</name> adapted their opinions because in the beginning of the novel it was the <choice><orig>oppisite</orig><reg>opposite</reg></choice> he had.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In line 17 <name type="person">Delaney</name> recognized the man he was was <choice><orig>mexican</orig><reg>Mexican</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>In the same <choice><orig>secound</orig><reg>second</reg></choice> <name type="person">Delaney</name> got in action, which is not very typical for <name type="person">Delaney</name>.</s>
        <s>So identifying a person as <choice><orig>mexican</orig><reg>Mexican</reg></choice> triggers all prejudices of <name type="person">Delaney</name>.</s>
        <s>From that point <name type="person">Delaney</name> is imagining every possible worst case, but to be fair he recognizes the man as the hiker, who <quote>soured the first half of one of the worst days of <name type="person">Delaney's</name> life</quote>, which boosts <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> prejudices and gives him some evidence for suspecting him as a criminal.</s>
        <s>In line 49 the narrator uses reported thought of <name type="person">Delaney</name>.</s>
        <s>It is a climax of accusations and settlements and on the end, the heaviest one is <quote>a Mexican</quote> which shows <name type="person">Delaney's</name> racist <choice><orig>behaves</orig><reg>behaviour</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>When <name type="person">José</name> stops grinning and changes his facial expression because <name type="person">Delaney</name> did not understand that he is delivering <choice><orig>fliers</orig><reg>flyers</reg></choice> due to the broken <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> of <name type="person">José</name>, <name type="person">Delaney</name> even accuses him to have a knife or a gun and is willing to use it, but right after this <name type="person">Delaney</name> realizes what he has done.</s>
        <s>The narrator uses a short inner <choice><orig>monolog</orig><reg>monologue</reg></choice> to show how <name type="person">Delaney</name> is questioning himself what has happened to him.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The author used a smart way to give the reader <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> impression why <name type="person">Delaney</name> undergoes this change.</s>
        <s>He hides the fact that <name type="person">José</name> is delivering <choice><orig>fliers</orig><reg>flyers</reg></choice> until the point <name type="person">Delaney</name> got it is on page 7.</s>
        <s>The reader also really knows what <name type="person">José</name> is a kind of person.</s>
        <s>The flat character that always causes problems for the main characters and in some way the reader built up prejudices against him.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Delaney</name> has convinced himself that this man is a criminal just as the reader.</s>

        <s>To sum it up I would say that on the one hand the narrator shows <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> development very well, which lets the reader less sympathize with his character.</s>
        <s>On the other hand the narrator <choice><orig>proofs</orig><reg>proves</reg></choice> that <name type="person">Delaney</name> is not <choice><orig>completly</orig><reg>completely</reg></choice> responsible for this development but in the end he is not reflecting what happened to him, which is the reason for his racist attitude.</s>
