        <s>The excerpt uses a panoramic description of <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> surroundings <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(ll. 33,34)</ref> through reported thought, where in he repeatedly <choice><orig>referrs</orig><reg>refers</reg></choice> to <quote>his own</quote> <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 33,34)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This underlines <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> indignation and builds up to the phrase <quote>You don't belong here</quote> <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 39)</ref>, which is a typical for a covert or open racist, who believes himself to be better than others.</s>
        <s>It also contains <choice><orig>symbolysm</orig><reg>symbolism</reg></choice> since <name type="person">Delaney</name> thinks of the <name type="person"><choice><orig>Cherrystones</orig><reg>Cherrystone's</reg></choice></name> lawn <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 36)</ref> but would not mind seeing <name type="person">José</name> deported either.</s>
        <s>This is made clear by the narrator, who comments on the force of the shock, which <name type="person">Delaney</name> gets, when he realizes that the trespasser is <choice><orig>mexican</orig><reg>Mexican</reg></choice> <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 17)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Apart from this the narrator describes <name type="person">José</name> in an almost magical way, when <name type="person">Delaney</name> first spots him <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 10,11)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This also shows that the narrator builds up the tension in unison with <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> rage, since the beginning of the scene has an <choice><orig>exagerated</orig><reg>exaggerated</reg></choice> peaceful and almost magical atmosphere.</s>
        <s>Furthermore the narrator goes on by using reported thought to show how <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> mood immediately changes, once he sees that the man is Mexican <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(ll. 16-17)</ref>.</s>
        <s>At once he is more alert and already he starts to get angry which is shown by the unfriendly way in which he adresses <name type="person">José</name> <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(ll. 17,18)</ref>.</s>
        <s><name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> rage gets stronger throughout the scene, which is caused by the mocking of <name type="person">José</name> and <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> helplessnes <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 33)</ref>.</s>
        <s>On the one hand this is shown through comments by the narrator, such as <quote>before he could think</quote> <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 42)</ref> where he shows that <name type="person">Delaney</name> acts on a racist and irrational <choice><orig>impuls</orig><reg>impulse</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>On the other hand the build up of rage is shown through many climaxes.</s>
        <s>This is the case when <name type="person">Delaney</name> insults <name type="person">José</name> and calls him a <quote>thief, a liar [...]</quote> and finally <quote>a Mexican</quote> <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(ll. 50,51)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Apart from the tension, <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> racism also becomes stronger in unison with his rage, which is shown when <name type="person">José</name> starts getting annoyed and <name type="person">Delaney</name> immediately <choice><orig>supects</orig><reg>suspects</reg></choice> that he has a knife or a gun <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 54,55)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The tension builds up to a breaking point while <name type="person">Delaney</name> speculates about whether or not he is about to be killed, until <name type="person">José</name> presents one of the <choice><orig>flies</orig><reg>flyers</reg></choice> as evidence that he is innocent <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(ll. 55-59)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In the last paragraph <name type="person">Delaney</name> is shown as devastated and shocked by himself <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(ll. 60f)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The narrator shows this through an inner monologue.</s>
        <s>This conveys that there is a change of the roles of <name type="person">José</name> and <name type="person">Delaney</name>.</s>
        <s>In the beginning <name type="person">José</name> is shown as the victim through comments by the narrator <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(l. 42)</ref>.</s>
        <s>However at the end of the excerpt <name type="person">Delaney</name> is cast into the role of the victim, who believes that he is to be pitied since he has been mocked by <name type="person">José</name> and driven into an unwanted rage <ref target="b11lk1_1" type="line">(ll. 60-65)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion, the narrator uses a lot of climaxes and <q>streams of conciousness</q> to show build up of <name type="person"><choice><orig>Delaneys</orig><reg>Delaney's</reg></choice></name> rage, which also builds up tensions in unison.</s>
