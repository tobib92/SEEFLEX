        <s>In his speech <ref target="c11gk2_1" type="speaker">Michel Barnier</ref> stated that the <name type="misc">Brexit</name> is a lose-lose situation for both.</s>
        <s>I would agree partly with him because it's way worse for <name type="geo">Britain</name> than for <name type="geo">Europe</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><name type="geo">Britain</name> suffers from several shortages like truck drivers and even some products, because of new travel restrictions for workers which are caused by the <name type="misc">Brexit</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Moreover companies in the <name type="geo">UK</name> are challenged with new paperwork, which is also caused by the <name type="misc">Brexit</name> while I as a European haven't even noticed any change since <name type="geo">Britain</name> left the <name type="misc">EU</name>.</s>
        <s>Of course some European companies may also suffer from the new paperwork.</s>
        <s>But in general the life in the <name type="misc">EU</name> hasn't changed.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So in conclusion, I don't think that it's a <choice><orig>reel</orig><reg>real</reg></choice> lose-lose situation.</s>
