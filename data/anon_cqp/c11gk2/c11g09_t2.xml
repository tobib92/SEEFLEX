        <s>He states, that it would be in <quote>a common interest</quote> <ref target="c11gk2_1" type="line">(l. 16)</ref> to achieve this.</s>

        <s>To end his list of ideas to keep a good relationship, he says that the European equivalence system also works for the <name type="misc">Brexit</name> <ref target="c11gk2_1" type="line">(cf. ll. 20ff.)</ref>.</s>

        <s>He then ends his speech by think his audience.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>What belongs to the stylistic <choice><orig>divices</orig><reg>devices</reg></choice> and his choice of words, it is obvious to see that he often uses the personal pronouns <quote>I</quote> or <quote>my</quote> in combination with a verb like <quote>conviction</quote> or <quote>think</quote> to express his thoughts, but then uses the pronoun <quote>we</quote> to catch his audience and put them into his <choice><orig>planes</orig><reg>plans</reg></choice> <ref target="c11gk2_1" type="line">(e.g. l. 1, l. 15)</ref> with this construction of words he catches the <gap reason="illegible" quantity="1" unit="word">ation</gap> of the audience by saying that he <add>(the narrator)</add> and the listeners should do something as a group.</s>

      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Furthermore he uses the word channel in l. 11 in a <choice><orig>metephortial</orig><reg>metaphorical</reg></choice> way to connect the real physical <choice><orig>boarder</orig><reg>border</reg></choice> of the <name type="misc">EU</name> and the <name type="geo">UK</name> with the political <choice><orig>boarder</orig><reg>border</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>By doing that he expresses that the <choice><orig>boarders</orig><reg>borders</reg></choice> or the <choice><orig>diffrences</orig><reg>differences</reg></choice> of <choice><orig>bosth</orig><reg>both</reg></choice> unions ain't that big.</s>

      <p>
        <s>Other <choice><orig>then</orig><reg>than</reg></choice> this he uses an alliteration in l. 25 with <quote>which works well</quote>.</s>

      <p>
        <s>One line after this he uses a rhetorical question with <quote>[...] not work for the UK?</quote>.</s>

        <s>Moreover he uses a couple of stylistic devices to express how good the <choice><orig>european</orig><reg>European</reg></choice> system works and to make his speech more <choice><orig>intresting</orig><reg>interesting</reg></choice> and interactive for his audience.</s>
