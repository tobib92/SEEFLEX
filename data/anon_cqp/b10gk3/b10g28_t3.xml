        <s>This scene is a little bit different from the novel version.</s>
        <s>The encounter with the police was caused by an argument between <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> and <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">King</ref> but rather between <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> and <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mr. Lewis</ref>.</s>
        <s>However I still do believe that this scene is <choice><orig>faithfull</orig><reg>faithful</reg></choice> enough and <choice><orig>manges</orig><reg>manages</reg></choice> to display the purpose <choice><orig>pefectly</orig><reg>pefectly</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>From my point of view the racial profiling some police men in the <name type="geo">United States</name> do and this scene manages to show this.</s>
        <s>The police asked for an just because they saw a gangster looking black person.</s>
        <s>What I also liked about this scene was the emotions the audience feels when watching it.</s>
        <s>However I still think there is criticism for this scene because in the novel <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mr. Lewis</ref> and <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> held together against the police and beautifully displayed how even though they may have different opinions they have behold together to fight their same enemy.</s>

        <s>All in all I can say that this scene drifted a little bit up from the novel but still managed to display the main purpose of the scene.</s>
