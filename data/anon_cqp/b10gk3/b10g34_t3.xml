        <s>In my opinion the given scene focuses more on the problem of gangs than in the novel since in the novel <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> argues with a <q>normal</q> <choice><orig>civillian</orig><reg>civilian</reg></choice> while in the movie he argues with a <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">King Lord</ref> which concludes to the fact that the argument between a <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">King lord</ref> and <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> is more dangerous than the argument with a <choice><orig>civillian</orig><reg>civilian</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>With this the police is given an excuse for inspecting <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> and pressing him on the ground because in the novel he talks and in the movie he uses his force.</s>
        <s>Concluding, the movie doesn't focus much on the racism behind police force but more on the problems concerning gang activities.</s>

      <p>
        <s>So in my eyes, the movie doesn't present the idea of the novel to emphasize the racism behind the polcie and their wage of force.</s>
