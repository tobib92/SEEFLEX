        <s>The novel <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref> written by <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="author">Angie Thomas</ref> and the same titled movie directed by <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="director">George Tillmann Jr.</ref> sure have some differences: In the novel, <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> was arguing with <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mr. Lewis</ref> and in the movie he <choice><orig>almoast</orig><reg>almost</reg></choice> had a fight <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">King</ref> and some of his gang members.</s>

        <s>Or another difference is that <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> wasn't eating dinner with his family in the novel, he was working in his store.</s>
        <s>However, these small things <choice><orig>doesn't</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> change the real meaning of the <choice><orig>szene</orig><reg>scene</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>The sequence shows the audience how intense and unfair police brutality is, and that is very good portrayed in both movie and novel.</s>

      <p>
        <s>The movie still captures the most important details, for example the one police officer being black or him holding <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> down with his knee in his back.</s>
        <s>Both break the stereotype of black people always holding together and confuse the reader/viewer with the question why the black police officer would do this.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>By still <choice><orig>fullfilling</orig><reg>fulfilling</reg></choice> the original meaning of the interaction with the officers, I think that the movie is <choice><orig>faithfull</orig><reg>faithful</reg></choice> to the <choice><orig>novels</orig><reg>novel's</reg></choice> idea and purpose.</s>
