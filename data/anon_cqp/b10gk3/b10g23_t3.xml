        <s>There are big differences between the novel's scene and the movie's one.</s>
        <s>The most important one is the context of the cops showing up.</s>
        <s>While in the novel it's <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mav</ref> and his neighbor arguing <add>(normally, without violence)</add> it's a little harsher in the movie.</s>
        <s>There, <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mav</ref> and <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">King</ref> were about to actually fight with the possibility to end bloody.</s>
        <s>That's a normal reason for cops to intervene <add>(without treating <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mav</ref> and his family that disrespectful)</add>, while in the book it's really an example of police violence against innocent, since <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mav</ref> and the neighbor tried to convince the cops that everything's right and nothing happened.</s>
        <s>Still they treat <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mav</ref> as harsh as in the movie, what fits more into the whole idea of the story, police violence and racism.</s>
        <s>The movie's version still does the job, but not hald as well as the book version.</s>
