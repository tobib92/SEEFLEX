        <s>The problems with the textile industry and what we can do to improve the situation.</s>

      <p>
        <s>The bad situation in the textile industry is very important, but can we do anything and if we do what can we do?</s>
        <s>I will answer that in my article.</s>

        <s>My source for this article is the interview <ref target="a10gk2_2" type="title">Fast Fashion: Unser Kleiderkonsum ist Wahnsinn</ref> written by <ref target="a10gk2_2" type="author">JÃ¶rg Oberwittler</ref> and published in <name type="misc">Spiegel Online</name> on the <date>21 December 2017</date>.</s>

        <s>One problem of the textile industry is that they throw their trash and chemicals into rivers and destroy the <choice><orig>enviroment</orig><reg>environment</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The workers there work ten to twelve hours a day and only have one free day per week.</s>
        <s>Besides that the workers develop <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> mentality of producing as much as possible even if it hurts them.</s>
        <s>A boycott is not the solution because the people there would have no income and the companies would just go to another country.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>We should instead support labels who support better working conditions and the government should finally do something against the exploitation of the workers.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion you should support labels who are for better conditions and try to make the government finally do something.</s>
        <s>We should do that because such bad conditions at this time should not be tolerated any longer.</s>
