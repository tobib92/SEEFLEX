        <s>Firstly the author explains how <choice><orig>usefull</orig><reg>useful</reg></choice> the unions have been, because they helped the workers all over the world to get treated better in points like working conditions, shorter working days and higher <choice><orig>wadges</orig><reg>wages</reg></choice>.</s>
