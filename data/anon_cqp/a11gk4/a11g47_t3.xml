        <salute>Dear Selin,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>after you mailed me, what your schoolboard wants to do, I was in shock.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><name type="misc">THUG</name> is a book that shows reality and wants to shake <choice><orig>peoples</orig><reg>people's</reg></choice> mind.</s>
        <s>Naturally the book needs to have vulgarity, offensive language and the other bad sites in order to convey those messages.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Not only in <name type="geo">America</name> but <choice><orig>worlwide</orig><reg>world-wide</reg></choice> the problems which are shown in the book are problems which need to be clarified.</s>
        <s>Your schoolboard <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> deny that police brutality, use of drugs and racism are actual problems <choice><orig>worlwide</orig><reg>world-wide</reg></choice> that need to be taken care of.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>After the first time we have read it in school there was so much that actually happened.</s>
        <s>It reminded me of the case <name type="person">George Floyd</name> and pinpointed where the problems have <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>their</reg></choice> cause.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I not only think that it's a book to show those problems but moreover help identify the cause.</s>
        <s>This is in my opinion even more important, because then we can talk how to deal with them.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I support your idea to talk with the schoolboard and hope that you will be able to make it.</s>
      </p>
