        <s>Black people also tend to get controlled by the police far more often and their financial sitaution is worse if you look at it in a whole.</s>

        <s>I know you attend an American <choice><orig>highschool</orig><reg>high school</reg></choice> and thus I wanted to ask whether you experienced some of that or can tell me about your experience.</s>
        <s>I find it still hard to believe although I know about <name type="misc">BLM</name> and some incidents that took place, because it is not present in my surrounding.</s>
        <s>I'll wait for your response.</s>
