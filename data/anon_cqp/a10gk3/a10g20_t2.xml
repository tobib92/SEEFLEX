        <s><ref target="a10gk3_1" type="author">Ankita Mitra</ref> is clearly positioned against the <choice><orig>envoironment</orig><reg>environment</reg></choice> pollution.</s>
        <s>She tries to convince the reader to do <choice><abbr>sth</abbr><expan>something</expan></choice> against it, to stop this pollution, by using strategies.</s>

        <s>The article is written in a subjective way.</s>
        <s>The author shows her opinion to us.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To convince the reader she uses many enumerations, for example in l. 6 <quote>no man, no animal, no plants</quote> or <quote>effects on sea life, on crops and on human health</quote> <ref target="a10gk3_1" type="line">(l. 15/16)</ref>.</s>
        <s>With this <choice><orig>rethorical</orig><reg>rhetorical</reg></choice> device she underlines the arguments, by showing us three aspects or examples.</s>
        <s>Another device is used in line 29 <quote>incurable diseases</quote> or in line 31 <quote>era of man extinction</quote>.</s>
        <s>Here she uses negative words and exaggeration to underscore the <choice><orig>nesseserity</orig><reg>necessity</reg></choice> of the solution of this big problem.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><choice><orig>On</orig><reg>One</reg></choice> of ther strategies is the inclusive language.</s>
        <s>It were used only the prepositions <quote>we</quote>/<quote>our</quote>.</s>
        <s>So it is clear that the problem of the pollution affects us all living beings on the earth.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>She uses many <choice><orig>describtion</orig><reg>description</reg></choice> of the earth (for example line 7: <quote>oxygen</quote>, <quote>nitrogen</quote>, ...) to show us miracle this earth is and that we should take care of it.</s>
        <s>Moreover she uses formal language and uses many specific words of the nature field (<ref target="a10gk3_1" type="line">l. 27</ref>: <quote>nitrogen fertilizers</quote>).</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>She uses many but also convincing arguments.</s>
        <s>For this arguments she bases on facts that we all know about the environment pollution and also on <choice><orig>sepcifyed</orig><reg>specified</reg></choice> <choice><orig>knollege</orig><reg>knowledge</reg></choice> for this subject.</s>
        <s>Moreover she uses an example <ref target="a10gk3_1" type="line">(l. 32-35)</ref> to get us closer to the <choice><orig>consequenzes</orig><reg>consequences</reg></choice> of this big problem.</s>
        <s>In the first paragraph <ref target="a10gk3_1" type="line">(l. 36-40)</ref> the author appeals to the reader that we should do <choice><abbr>sth</abbr><expan>something</expan></choice> <choice><orig>emideatly</orig><reg>immediately</reg></choice> to stop it.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion you can say that the environment pollution involves everyone and so everybody needs to do <choice><abbr>sth</abbr><expan>something</expan></choice> to stop this problem.</s>
