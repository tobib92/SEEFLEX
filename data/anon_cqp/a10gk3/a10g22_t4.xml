        <s>I heard you praise the effects of globalisation and the free market.</s>
        <s>As far as I'm on your side, I also think you should consider these bad sides of globalisation mentioned in an article about seamstresses in <name type="geo">Cambodia</name> published in <name type="misc">Spiegel Online</name> by <ref target="a10gk3_2" type="author">Nike Laurenz</ref>.</s>

        <s>They're shocked by this cruel and poor side of globalisation, knowing it before just as fancy clothing and products from all over the world.</s>
