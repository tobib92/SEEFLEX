        <salute>Hey John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>how are you?</s>
        <s>I'm fine.</s>
        <s>Last week I read an article at a <choice><orig>norway</orig><reg>Norwegian</reg></choice> newspaper.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Three young people, who are interested in fashion, visited a textile <choice><orig>industrie</orig><reg>industry</reg></choice> in <name type="geo">Cambodia</name>.</s>
        <s>They wanted to see, how life of a seamstress in <name type="geo">Cambodia</name> is.</s>
        <s>I know, that you always <choice><orig>prais</orig><reg>praise</reg></choice> the effects of globalisation, but you easily forget about the poor people in these countries.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So I decided to write a few things about this article.</s>
        <s>Maybe it is something for you.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>When <name type="person">Anniken</name>, <name type="person">Frida</name> and <name type="person">Ludvig</name> arrived at the textile <choice><orig>industrie</orig><reg>industry</reg></choice>, their life <choice><orig>completly</orig><reg>completely</reg></choice> changed for these days.</s>
        <s>They talked to the people who worked there, they visited supermarkets and shops for clothes, they slept in a little house of a seamstress and they also shared a mattress for the night.</s>
        <s>In addition the three people, ate a lot of rice and had to look after themselves.</s>
        <s>At the end, <name type="person">Anniken</name>, <name type="person">Frida</name> and <name type="person">Ludvig</name> were shocked.</s>
        <s>They didn't <choice><orig>expact</orig><reg>expect</reg></choice> this situation.</s>
        <s>They also said, that they had to do the same work every single day and every time.</s>
        <s>So they decided to stand up and to do something against the workers at the textile <choice><orig>industrie</orig><reg>industry</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Of course, you can read a lot more of this article, but I decided to tell you the important information.</s>
        <s>If you want to read more of the article, I can send you the link too.</s>
        <s>I hope, you change your opinion and I also hope that you don't forget these people in the future.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>See you soon.</s>
