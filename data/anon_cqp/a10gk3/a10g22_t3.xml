        <s>As a lot of pollution refers to human activity, humans will be able to stop pollution.</s>
        <s>In the following I'm going to suggest feasible measures to help solving the global problem of environmental pollution.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my opinion, everyone should keep solving the problem of environmental pollution, because we're all affected by it.</s>
        <s>But I also think that when everyone gets involved, it won't be <choice><orig>necassary</orig><reg>necessary</reg></choice> to get back in time and live without cars and such.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>At first, every human should be schooled in the causes and effects of environmental pollution, because it will help finding measures to tackle the problem.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Second, we must overthink our behavior with shopping and buying.</s>
        <s>We should only buy what we need to save ressources.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>At last, it's important to repair and recycle products such as clothes or furniture, which is also associated with buying less.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Finally, I don't think we have to fear the climatic changes, but it's <choice><orig>necassary</orig><reg>necessary</reg></choice> to tackle the problem to save lives and habitat of both humans and animals.</s>
