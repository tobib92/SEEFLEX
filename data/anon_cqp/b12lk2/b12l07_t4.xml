        <s>The <name type="geo">Glasgow</name> conference which was aiming to solve the global challenges that we are facing right now was not held long ago.</s>
        <s>But it was enough to have an opinion about it.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So has <name type="person">Ant√≥nio Guterrez</name>, known as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, because even though she wants to spread hope regarding the climate crisis, he is quite skeptical about the outcome of the conference.</s>
        <s><ref target="b12lk2_2" type="speaker">Jochen Flasbarth</ref>, State secretary Ministry for the Environment and Nature Protection in <name type="geo">Germany</name> does not agree with <name type="person">Guterrez</name>.</s>
        <s>In his opinion the conference room a step forward.</s>
        <s>According to <ref target="b12lk2_2" type="speaker">Flasbarth</ref>, many people overestimate the conference because there are not able to solve everything immediately.</s>
        <s>It is quite time consuming.</s>
        <s>But how much time do we have left?</s>
        <s>This question cannot only scientist answer but especially smaller countries that are suffering from the global warming.</s>
        <s>Because they cannot afford to talk any longer about the issue but need help for the action.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In order to change something the countries have to make concrete plans, that are realistic.</s>
        <s>It did not work out very well as we can see the result of stopping the promotion of coal which has been weakened.</s>
        <s>Because <name type="geo">India</name> and <name type="geo">China</name> do not want to stop their coal production.</s>
        <s>The actual aim is to <quote>phase down</quote> the production.</s>
        <s><ref target="b12lk2_2" type="speaker">Flasbarth</ref> still sees it optimistic because it was not even planned to discuss the abandonment of coal, so for him is it one step in the right direction.</s>
        <s>He sees <name type="geo">Glasgow</name> as a success.</s>
        <s>But not everybody agrees, many people see it as a <quote>show</quote> because the countries blame each other and do not want to take responsibility.</s>
        <s>We can see that with <name type="geo">France</name>, who arm themselves with more nuclear power.</s>
        <s><name type="geo">Germany</name> has also ambitious goals for the future such as only using renewable energy for electricity.</s>
        <s>If there are able to realize this plan, we will see.</s>
