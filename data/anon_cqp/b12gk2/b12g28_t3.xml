        <s>recently I read your statement form a speech which you gave roughly before 30 years.</s>
        <s>These days I was a young person and was <choice><orig>hopefull</orig><reg>hopeful</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>But now I see that the generations before me and we failed.</s>
        <s>You were right.</s>
        <s>We had all these possibilities to act, to change the future, to take action, but nobody did it.</s>
        <s>Okay honestly some people take action with demonstrations etc. but the leaders, those who had the power didn't.</s>
        <s>So <choice><orig>know</orig><reg>now</reg></choice> our children make your and my generation responsible for this bad world ... Just like you said in those days.</s>
