        <s>Environmental pollution has been a problem for decades.</s>
        <s>With rising contamination it should be our job to keep the <choice><orig>Earth</orig><reg>earth</reg></choice> in a good state.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>While there are many pros, such as going by car, plane or ships, this is very bad for the environment.</s>
        <s>Other pro arguments might be the production of utilities and gadgets mankind might need.</s>
        <s>Also rising technology can have a big impact on upgrading the quality of life on <choice><orig>Earth</orig><reg>earth</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>But it is to consider, that with a contaminated atmosphere and no drinking water there is no point for all of that, since the conditions for life aren't given.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To change that, we need ot change our habits, that being things as to recycle, and clean the environment in organizations that focus on removing environmental pollution.</s>
        <s>Other ways of contributing are e.g. things like buying less products with plastic packaging.</s>
