        <s>In the following, I am going to <choice><orig>analize</orig><reg>analyze</reg></choice> the dialogue between <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter</ref> and <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth</ref> with a special focus on <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Walters</orig><reg>Walter's</reg></choice></ref> dream and how he wants to achieve it.</s>

        <s>He thinks that he is worth less than the white <choice><orig>buisnessmen</orig><reg>businessmen</reg></choice> he drives around in his job as a chauffeur without upwards mobility.</s>
        <s>So he wants to escape this lower position and be a masculine role model for his son that can offer him anything.</s>

        <s>He regrets that he missed a job <choice><orig>oppurtunity</orig><reg>opportunity</reg></choice> once that could have made him independent <quote><qs>When [Charlie Atkins] wanted me to go in the dry-cleaning business with him.</qs><qs>And now- he's grossing a hundred thousand a year</qs></quote> <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="line">(l. 7f.)</ref> he is tired of their life in poorness and thinks that <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth</ref> sees it the same way <quote><qs>You tired, ain't you?</qs><qs>Tired of everything</qs></quote> <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="line">(l. 11)</ref>.</s>

        <s>In this way <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Walters</orig><reg>Walter's</reg></choice></ref> dream is hard and almost impossible to realize but he holds on to it.</s>
