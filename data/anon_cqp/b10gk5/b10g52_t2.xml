        <s>The director used many different stylistic devices like slow motion or close ups to present and show <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> and his relationship with his girlfriend <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref>.</s>
        <s>Important is that he does that, to <choice><orig>ecspecially</orig><reg>especially</reg></choice> show the facial expression and emotions from either <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> or <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref>.</s>
        <s>Noticeable is that the director introduced us in the scene with a medium long shot size.</s>
        <s>He does that to show the action of <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> and really <choice><orig>let's</orig><reg>lets</reg></choice> us focus on them but also to connect him with the background so we likely know what is about to happen.</s>
        <s>Additionally the director used a very important and well known stylistic feature called slow motion.</s>
        <s>This lets us focus even more on <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> actions and together with the usage of slow, sad music it creates a loving atmosphere.</s>
        <s>With all these <choice><orig>informations</orig><reg>information</reg></choice> you can clearly say that the camera is made to be <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> point of view.</s>
        <s>She is in love with <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref>, that's why the director used slow motion and romantic music.</s>
        <s>Another valid argument for this statement is that in the next scene, directly following after the one I analyzed, <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> described <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Chris</orig><reg>Chris'</reg></choice></ref> outfit in detail and also said how much she likes it: <quote>he knows Jordans are my weakness</quote>.</s>
        <s>To bring some structure in the following analyzation, I will <choice><orig>devide</orig><reg>divide</reg></choice> the whole <choice><orig>szene</orig><reg>scene</reg></choice> in three parts.</s>
        <s>The first one that I already analyzed about <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> walking down the hallway.</s>
        <s>Afterwards <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> and <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> having a conflict and then <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> forgiving <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> in the end.</s>
        <s>The director used this structure to symbolize the strong love between <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> and <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> and that they can forgive and love each other no matter what happened in the past.</s>
        <s>We get <choice><orig>Introtuced</orig><reg>introduced</reg></choice> in the next scene with <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> noticing <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> and a big camera angle change, in which you can see <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> starring directly into <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Chris</orig><reg>Chris'</reg></choice></ref> eyes.</s>
        <s>Again the director used this camera movement to show that <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> was watching <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> the whole time and that <choice><orig>shes</orig><reg>she's</reg></choice> heavily in love with him.</s>
        <s>The scene is in <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> extreme or big close up shot size to really make us focus on details.</s>
        <s>Now the background is fully invisible and you can only see <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr's</ref> face.</s>
        <s>From now on, the emotions and the facial expression is way more important than anything else.</s>
        <s>Still the director <choice><orig>want's</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> you to pay attention on what <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> does and also <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr's</ref> reaction to that.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref><choice><orig>put's</orig><reg>puts</reg></choice> his headphones over <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr's</ref> ears to let her hear his new beat that he made.</s>
        <s>He does that to create a happy mood which he also <choice><orig>get's</orig><reg>gets</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>Important to say is that through the big close up, you can see <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> smiling but then trying to avoid it because she is mad at <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref>.</s>
        <s>The director does this to show <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> love to <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> even <choice><orig>tho</orig><reg>though</reg></choice> she is mad at him.</s>
        <s>Throughout the scene the editing between <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> and <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Chris</orig><reg>Chris'</reg></choice></ref> faces switching is very important.</s>
        <s>The director does that so you can see both facial expressions and emotions.</s>
        <s>Additionally this <choice><orig>get's</orig><reg>gets</reg></choice> underlined with the usage of a big close up.</s>
        <s>In the end <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> couldn't resist showing her love to <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> and he <choice><orig>start's</orig><reg>starts</reg></choice> to dance to his beat.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Again the slow motion effect <choice><orig>get's</orig><reg>gets</reg></choice> in usage and the camera is switching between <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> and <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Chrises</orig><reg>Chris'</reg></choice></ref> face to show the emotions.</s>
        <s>The scene is in a medium what size so you can also see the background and focus on both the actions and it.</s>
        <s>The director does this to create a slightly <choice><orig>embarassing</orig><reg>embarrassing</reg></choice> situation which is also quiet funny.</s>
        <s>To sum it up all given stylistic devices are there to show the healthy relationship between <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> and <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref>.</s>
        <s>They also let us empathize with <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref>.</s>
