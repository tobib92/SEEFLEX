        <s>In the following text I will comment on the film <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref> by saying how any why it impacts myself.</s>

        <s>The movie is very emotional.</s>
        <s>It shows the story of a black teenage girl who experienced police brutality and racism.</s>
        <s>There are many situations that are very emotional in this film.</s>
        <s>This movie showed myself how hard it is to experience racism and to cover yourself because of your colour of your skin.</s>
        <s>Last year we all experienced the black lives matter <choice><orig>dimenstrations</orig><reg>demonstrations</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>This movie showed me again that we should do something against racism.</s>
        <s>It breaks my heart to see how a teenage girl and the children for example <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Sekani</ref> are suffering because of people like <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Hailey</ref>.</s>
        <s>This movie doesn't impact my <choice><orig>perspectiv</orig><reg>perspective</reg></choice> because I already know that this isn't right but it made my opinion against racism stronger.</s>
