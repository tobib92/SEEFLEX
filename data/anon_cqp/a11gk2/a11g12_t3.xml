        <s>He also said that there are no <choice><orig>barriert</orig><reg>barriers</reg></choice> to success in <name type="geo">America</name>.</s>
        <s>But is there really not <choice><orig>barriere</orig><reg>barrier</reg></choice>?</s>
        <s>Is racism not a problem anymore?</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>From my point of view it is not possible to say this with 100% meaning.</s>
        <s>There would be always a problem and <choice><orig>barriere</orig><reg>barrier</reg></choice> for some of us.</s>
        <s>It is not that easy <choice><orig>so</orig><reg>to</reg></choice> success with problems.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Like <ref target="a11gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> said, you have to believe in American <choice><orig>dreams</orig><reg>Dream</reg></choice> it is really important for all of us to do this.</s>
        <s>When everyone would do this then it would be more easier to success in life without the problems.</s>

        <s>On the one hand it is better than a few years ago.</s>
        <s>It is not that important anymore what for skin color you have or what your religion is, but on the other hand there are <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> many people in some countries who are not for the American dream.</s>

      <p>
        <s>My statement is that I would not agree with <ref target="a11gk2_1" type="speaker"><choice><orig>Obamas</orig><reg>Obama's</reg></choice></ref> opinion because you <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> say right now that there are no barriers anymore.</s>
        <s>He is thinking very positive which is good but I think this not the reality so I would not agree with 100%.</s>
