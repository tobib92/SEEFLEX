      <p>
        <s>I just read your speech of <name type="misc">COP26</name> in <date>2021</date> again and I had to think about the statement <quote><qs>And let us think of the billions of unborn, whose anger will be all the grater if we fail.</qs><qs>We cannot let them down.</qs><qs>We have the ideas.</qs><qs>We have the technology.</qs><qs>We have the bankers.</qs><qs>We have the corperations and the NGOs</qs></quote>.</s>
        <s>You were right.</s>
        <s>You had the ideas and the technology.</s>
        <s>You had the banker, the corperations and the NGOs.</s>
        <s>Therefore you could and should have done more.</s>
        <s>Yes you were able to do a little bit.</s>
        <s>But that wasn't enough.</s>
        <s>You can have as many ideas as you want but you need to put them into practice properly and think them <choice><orig>completly</orig><reg>completely</reg></choice> through if these ideas are even realistic.</s>
        <s>Anyways, I know you had good intentions and really wanted to something, but now it's my generation that has to pay for your mistakes.</s>
