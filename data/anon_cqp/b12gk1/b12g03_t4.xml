        <salute>Hello Mr. Drane,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope you are well in this time during COVID-19.</s>
        <s>Yesterday you sent me or a newspaper article from our school homepage because you wanted to know what <name type="misc">KLS goes green</name> is exactly about.</s>
        <s>I am sorry I couldn't write you already yesterday but I had to learn for my <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> exam.</s>
        <s>But now to <name type="misc">KLS goes green</name>.</s>
        <s><name type="misc">KLS goes green</name> is a day in our school where we are talking about climate change and what we can do against it.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>But we are not making it in a boring way, through this day the school is offering to the students 40 different workshops in and out of school where we are talking in a fun way about the climate protection.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It all began that a lot of students were political interested in this topic and we're taking part of the <name type="misc">Fridays for future</name> movement.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Now we have on <name type="misc">KLS goes green</name> no school except for the workshops.</s>
        <s>Because of this day children or more students get interested in this topic.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope I could help you!</s>
      </p>
