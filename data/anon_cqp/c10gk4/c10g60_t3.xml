        <s>We've <choice><orig>speaked</orig><reg>spoken</reg></choice> 1 week ago about the topic student exchanges, you remember?</s>
        <s>Since then, some arguments you said just don't make really sense to me, you said that student exchanges are <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> waste of time.</s>
        <s>So since then, we've speaked in my <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> class about that topic, so I've decided to write you an <choice><orig>email</orig><reg>e-mail</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>There are many pros about <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> student exchange, but also some contras.</s>
        <s>So it's a little bit expensive, but it is worth it, because you can make impressions for your whole life.</s>
        <s>At school exchanges you not just learn something about yourself, you also learn something about other cultures and people, this gives you <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> whole other impression of the world.</s>
        <s>It also helps to cool down some really dangerous situations between two <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice>, because you're going to understand the people better, because you know the people better.</s>
        <s>School exchanges also can inforce your language skills, so for example you're going abroad as <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> and make a year in <name type="geo">America</name>, it gives you a whole another feeling for language.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So, I think I said enough for the moment.</s>
        <s>Hit me up whenever you've time.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>See you,</s>
