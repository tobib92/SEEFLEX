        <s>if you think student exchanges are a waste of time you should <choice><orig>definitly</orig><reg>definitely</reg></choice> consider the arguments <ref target="c10gk4_1" type="speaker">Barack Obama</ref> provided in his speech <ref target="c10gk4_1" type="title">Remarks of president Barack Obama at student roundtable</ref> because they may change your opinion.</s>

        <s>Student exchanges are a great way to rebuild a <choice><orig>realationship</orig><reg>relationship</reg></choice> with other countries, but even more crucial is the fact that you get to know other people and put your differences aside.</s>
        <s>Therefore they are also a great way of getting rid of your prejudices.</s>
        <s>It may be negative that you might get homesick, but there is always the opportunity to leave early if you really want to, so why not try?</s>
        <s>In addition you also learn to be more <choice><orig>independant</orig><reg>independent</reg></choice> and the new language skills you get could even be helpful in school.</s>
        <s>All in all you should reconsider your opinion because there are really a lot of advantages to going abroad.</s>
