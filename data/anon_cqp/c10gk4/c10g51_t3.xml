        <s>I have been thinking a lot about your statement and opinion to student exchanges and from my point of view it is a little bit different.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The most obvious pro of making an exchange is to improve your skills of <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> foreign language is speaking and writing.</s>
        <s>Even if it costs a lot of money, you travel a lot, see towns, nature and culture which you can't see on your own at your homeland.</s>
        <s>You can make friends, live like the people there and learn much about the country and its education system.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>These all pros have a much more weight than the con with the money, because the experience you make is priceless.</s>
