        <s>The given excerpt focuses on <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby's</ref> difficulties of recapturing his past with <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref>, which shows his vulnerable and emotional side of his character.</s>

      <p>
        <s>At the beginning of the excerpt the narrator explains that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> was looking <quote>pale as death</quote> with his hands deep inside his coat pockets.</s>
        <s>This indicates that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> is nervous about his encounter with <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> and his hands in his pockets underline that he wants to hide himself just like his hands due to the <choice><orig>embarassment</orig><reg>embarrassment</reg></choice> he is feeling <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 84, l. 14-15)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The <quote>sharply</quote> turn <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> takes into the living room shows his overwhelment <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 84, l. 18)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Furthermore the fact that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> is keeping his hands inside his pockets throughout the whole situation, symbolizes his <choice><orig>embarassment</orig><reg>embarrassment</reg></choice> even more.</s>
        <s>As <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> then encounters <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> he mutters <quote>We've met before</quote> even though his eyes were glancing and his lips attempted to laugh, which gives a contradiction between the previous <choice><orig>embarassment</orig><reg>embarrassment</reg></choice> and his happiness of seeing <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 85, l. 3)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In addition his waiting pose he is sitting in on the chair, shows the shallowness he is now feeling, because <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> is unsure about what he will say, which gets underlined by the fact that he gives a plump excuse about the clock, he nearly destroyed before by slamming it with his hands as he couldn't sit still because of his insecurity <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 85, l. 9)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Furthermore <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> answers <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Daisys</orig><reg>Daisy's</reg></choice></ref> statement that they haven't seen each other for years, instantly with the exact time they haven't seen.</s>
        <s>This memorization of <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> indicates that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> has been waiting for their day of reunion undoubtly and it shows that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> has thought about her a lot.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>After that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Nick</ref> and <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> primaly have a conversation without <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> included, which underlines their insecurities of talking to each other <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 85, l. 23-24)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Furthermore <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Nick</ref> wants to leave the situation to get <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> and <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> closer, but <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> escapes the situation as well by telling <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Nick</ref> he needs to talk with him <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 85, l. 29)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This try of escaping the situation indicates <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby's</ref> overwhelment once more and as <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> tells <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Nick</ref> that this meeting would be a mistake his pure insecurity gets to the focus <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 86, l. 2)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Additionally the narrator explains that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> made a <quote>nervous circuit</quote> around his house right before his and <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy's</ref> encounter.</s>
        <s>This shows that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> is nervous on the one hand, but unsure on the other hand, as he probably used that time to think about what was going to happen and what he was going to say or about if it was right to meet <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 86, l. 14)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In addition as <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> returned into the living room after putting himself together a mysterious, but beautiful situation is created by <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> and <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> staring at each other in a way like they would rave from each other.</s>
        <s><ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby's</ref> face is <choice><orig>descriped</orig><reg>described</reg></choice> as glowing and the narrator detects a change in <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref>, which is the change from his normally mysterious, shy and antisocial traits to this moment where he shows his emotions and rave he has for <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 87, l. 9f.)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Furthermore as <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Nick</ref> reenters the scene, <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> greets him like they haven't seen each other for years, which symbolizes that he is primaly confused due to his overwhelment but indicates that this short time with <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> felt like years for him, as it was such a special encounter for him <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 87, l. 16)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In addition the fact that it was raining outside the house throughout the whole scene until that moment is a contradiction which shows how this previous weird and <choice><orig>embarassing</orig><reg>embarrassing</reg></choice> situation is now overshadowed by positivity and happiness <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 87, l. 18)</ref>.</s>
        <s>After <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> then realises that the sun was shining into the house, which is a symbol for hope and positivity, he asks <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> what she thinks about it to know what she thinks of their reunion <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 87, l. 22)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>At the end of the scene <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> then invites <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> and <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Nick</ref> over to his mansion to keep this positive flow with <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy</ref> going, as he is now trying to impress and influence her with his wealth <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="line">(p. 87, l. 25)</ref>.</s>
        <s>To summarize <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby's</ref> behaviour and character in <choice><orig>comparasion</orig><reg>comparison</reg></choice> to him in the scenes before one can see that <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> has this vulnerable side in his character when it comes to love, friendship and in <choice><orig>generall</orig><reg>general</reg></choice> social contact.</s>
        <s>This is because <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> puts a lot of value in his status and it is important for him that people like him and so he tries to impress the people around him with his earnings like his medals from the war or just his wealth.</s>
        <s>Furthermore in the previous scenes, <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> was always seen a mysterious, closed up and cold-blooded, but this scene from <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby's</ref> and <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Daisy's</ref> reunion gives the exact contrast to what one normally thought of <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> as he opens up, shows emotions and creates a positive surrounding.</s>
        <s>In addition the narrative way of describing <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby's</ref> thoughts and behaviour gives the reader a closer understanding how <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> actually thinks and is a good method to underline the contrast of what the surrounding think of <ref target="b11lk2_1" type="character">Gatsby</ref> and how he is and what kind of contradictive character he actually is.</s>
