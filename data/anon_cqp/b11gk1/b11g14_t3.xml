        <s>The novel <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="title">Gun Love</ref> was published in the year <date>2019</date> and was written by <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="author">Jennifer Clement</ref>.</s>
        <s>It deals with the life of a girl named <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref>, who lives together with her mother in a trailer park in <name type="geo">Florida</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my following comment I'm focus on the problem that the <choice><abbr>CPS</abbr><expan>Child Protective Service</expan></choice> should have taken <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> away from <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>At first it can be said that this solution would break the relationship between <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref> and <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> but at least is her home a toxic and unhealthy environment and <choice><orig>this</orig><reg>these</reg></choice> bad conditions aren't good for a child like <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref>.</s>
        <s>She <choice><orig>have</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> to grow up under good conditions to live a better life and maybe to reach her goals.</s>
        <s>Of course is it at first <choice><orig>dificult</orig><reg>difficult</reg></choice> to find them but in this situation, the police have to go look at trailer parks.</s>
        <s>Not only for <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref>, for every child.</s>
        <s>A child <choice><orig>have</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> to grow up under good conditions because they are very young and they <choice><orig>doesn't</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> have a responsibility for the living in trailer park or under a bridge.</s>
        <s>If the <choice><abbr>CPS</abbr><expan>Child Protective Service</expan></choice> put her into a foster home is it important that the <choice><abbr>CPS</abbr><expan>Child Protective Service</expan></choice> should <choice><orig>controlle</orig><reg>control</reg></choice> the new life of <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> and this for two or three times in a week.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all is it important and the best solution that the <choice><abbr>CPS</abbr><expan>Child Protective Service</expan></choice> should have taken <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> away from her mother and put her into a foster home and help her to reach any goals, get a good education and to live a better and few years later independent life.</s>
        <s>Of course would the <choice><abbr>CPS</abbr><expan>Child Protective Service</expan></choice> broke the relationship between <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> and her mother and would make at first <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> sad, but this solution is the best way for <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> to live under good conditions.</s>

        <s>If for example parents paying with all their money drugs and have to live under a bridge or in a trailer park because of that, the children <choice><orig>doesn't</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> have the responsibility for this life.</s>
