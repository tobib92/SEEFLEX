        <s>In the following I will analyse the relationship between <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> and <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> and how <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> tries to convince her husband of murdering <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">King Duncan</ref>.</s>

        <s>She asks him many rhetorical questions <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 10 ff.)</ref> to outline that the convenient is favorable and questions his objection.</s>
        <s>She supports her rhetorical questions with a direct argument and uses an inversion she gives him a reason for his assignment.</s>
        <s>Moreover she uses further a rhetorical question <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 15)</ref>, that she answers with a parallelism <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 16 f.)</ref> and ambiguity <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 16)</ref> <quote>ornament of life</quote>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>But this doesn't really convince <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref>, so he agrees her, but he doubts indirect about the plan with the choice of word <quote>may</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 21)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Also <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> uses a further rhetorical question in line 23 to reveal the plan killing <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Duncan</ref>.</s>
