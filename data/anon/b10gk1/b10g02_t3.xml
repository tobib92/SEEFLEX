        <s>When asked, what impact the story of <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref> had on me and my life, I can tell that on my perspective the film has shown realistic parts of a teenage life and their <choice><orig>challanges</orig><reg>challenges</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>It has shown what feelings about the society and pressure from people around you means, also individually that not anyone has the same opportunities and chances in life.</s>
        <s>Besides that, very important theme of the story was racism.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>For me it really opened my eyes especially about <q>indirect</q> racism.</s>
        <s>That people do not have to speak for example directly racist with a black person to be racist and that small details in reaction can cause big insecurities and society problems.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all, I really liked the story of <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref>, because I think it can open many <choice><orig>peoples</orig><reg>people's</reg></choice> eyes about serious tpoics in society and also is a very exciting story.</s>
