        <s>The given scene shows the viewer how <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr</ref> tries to be mad at <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref> but doesn't last long because she can't resist him.</s>

        <s>The given scene can be split up into 3 parts.</s>
        <s>The first one <choice><orig>beeing</orig><reg>being</reg></choice>, <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr</ref> thinking of and crushing on <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref>, the second one being the argument of them both and lastly the reunion.</s>

        <s>The second one doesn't have any <choice><orig>musik</orig><reg>music</reg></choice> in it.</s>
        <s>It makes the viewer feel like this part is an important, serious but also honest discussion because all the focus is put on their words and <choice><orig>mimiks</orig><reg>mimics</reg></choice>, which usually show the emotions by one <choice><orig>quit</orig><reg>quite</reg></choice> obviously.</s>
        <s>As the scene starts, <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref> is presented in a slowmo sequence which was filmed in a medium shot, showing everything and everyone interacting with <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref>.</s>
        <s>He's smiling walking in a relaxed manner and giving high fives to some people.</s>
        <s>This sequence is a <choice><orig>powerfull</orig><reg>powerful</reg></choice> option to make the viewer see <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref> as someone special.</s>
        <s>But the slowmo continues as <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> thoughts are revealed.</s>
        <s>She thinks about his shoes and notices they're wearing the same.</s>
        <s><ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris'</ref> shoes can be seen as a symbol of connection or bond between the two, which is something <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr</ref> notices.</s>
        <s>As <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref> notices her she turns around and so as he approaches her from the back the viewer can see <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> face in a big close up, slightly revealing the actions around her, and <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref> putting a headset with playing <choice><orig>musik</orig><reg>music</reg></choice> on her ears.</s>
        <s>Because of the <choice><orig>choosen</orig><reg>chosen</reg></choice> <choice><orig>angel</orig><reg>angle</reg></choice> we as the viewer get a lot of insights on the situation.</s>
        <s>You can clearly see <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr</ref> smiling knowing <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref> can't see her but as she turns around the <choice><orig>cameraangel</orig><reg>camera angle</reg></choice> changes rapidly and her smile fades into an <choice><orig>anoyed</orig><reg>annoyed</reg></choice> looking face.</s>
        <s>This indicates, that she still likes him but doesn't want him to know.</s>
        <s>The argument between the two is filmed in a switch between two over the shoulder shots which each zoom in closer to <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr's</ref> and <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris'</ref> face as the conflict gets intenser.</s>
        <s>Because there is no <choice><orig>musik</orig><reg>music</reg></choice> the focus is put on the words <choice><orig>beeing</orig><reg>being</reg></choice> said and the camera <choice><orig>angels</orig><reg>angles</reg></choice> they're filmed in.</s>

        <s>As <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr</ref> loosens up the viewer starts to notice a few details, such as the camera slightly moving or <choice><orig>musik</orig><reg>music</reg></choice> starting to play.</s>
        <s>It gives <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> smile a deeper meaning and their relationship the feeling of a revival in the sense of things getting more lively and also new.</s>
        <s>To show the viewer that there has been a reunion <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Chris</orig><reg>Chris'</reg></choice></ref> dancing is filmed in a slowmo again, just like previously when <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr</ref> was crushing <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref>.</s>
        <s>It gives the feeling of <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr</ref> <choice><orig>beeing</orig><reg>being</reg></choice> happy to be back to the old habits of enjoying <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Chris</ref> instead of <choice><orig>beeing</orig><reg>being</reg></choice> mad on him.</s>
        <s>It seems like the fight was over before it started and <ref target="b10gk1_1" type="character">Starr</ref> didn't have no chance of <choice><orig>beeing</orig><reg>being</reg></choice> mad.</s>

        <s>Also you couldn't hear her thoughts anymore because the conflict between the two was solved and there <choice><orig>where</orig><reg>were</reg></choice> no more mysteries between the two.</s>
