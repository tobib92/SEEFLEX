        <s>First of all he tries to convince the reader that he's not against unions from the beginning and that he even supported unions at first.</s>
        <s>He also fixes his points with not saying that <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> just his opinion or that <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> just from his perspective.</s>
        <s>He says for example in line 17 that the situation has changed and not that it seems for him that the situation has changed.</s>
        <s>In the last part he speaks to the government with saying that they should look at this situation, and fixes again that the government will surely discover that what he writes about is true.</s>
