        <s>The informative text, written by <ref target="a10gk1_1" type="author">Brian Pollard</ref> was published in <name type="misc">The Gulf News</name> in <date>November 2011</date> and has the focus on the question whether or not the usefulness of unions in the protection of workers rights is coming to an end.</s>

      <p>
        <s>The author changes his view on the unions, throughout the article: While he was a fan of the unions in the beginning because they brough essential changes, such as better working conditions and many more, he saw the unions change into the negative.</s>
        <s>They focus less on the safety of the employees but more on themselves and the money they make.</s>
