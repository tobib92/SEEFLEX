      <p>
        <s>The unions have affected the workers <choice><orig>negativly</orig><reg>negatively</reg></choice> because of how high the price of their union-products have become.</s>

      <p>
        <s>The employees also have a lack of productivity since they are protected by the union contract because they don't fear to get fired anymore.</s>
