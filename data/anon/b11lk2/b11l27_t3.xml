        <s>He's always been one of my favorites out of my family.</s>
        <s>I still remember the good old times when aunt <name type="person">Emily</name> and uncle <name type="person">Donald</name> came over with him.</s>
        <s>These were nice times.</s>
        <s>No cheating husband, no friends that are nice to you but talk behind, no two-faced people in general.</s>
        <s>Just our small village in the beautiful <name type="geo">Midwest</name>.</s>
