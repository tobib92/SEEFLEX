        <s>And he also wouldn't just invite me over for tea.</s>
        <s>Why couldn't I also not bring <name type="person">Tom</name> along, maybe he wants to tell me something about him, maybe he knows something about his affair.</s>
        <s>What's going on why was he chuckling, there is something weird going on.</s>
        <s>I know this face!</s>
        <s>It's <name type="person">Jay</name>!</s>
        <s>Where was he?</s>
        <s>I thought he was dead.</s>
        <s>He looks so good and also rich.</s>
        <s>Something must have <choice><orig>happend</orig><reg>happened</reg></choice> to him.</s>
        <s>I am so excited to see him again, it was wrong to marry <name type="person">Tom</name>, I should just have waited for him.</s>
        <s>But why is he here, what does that mean?</s>
        <s>I really missed him.</s>
        <s>Why isn't he hardly talking at all?</s>
        <s>Am I doing something wrong?</s>
        <s>Oh, what does <name type="person">Nick</name> want to talk to him about?</s>
        <s>I am so happy to see him again.</s>
        <s>I thought I would never see him again.</s>
        <s>I wanna hug him right now.</s>
        <s>But it feels wrong.</s>
        <s>I know that, <name type="person">Tom</name> cheats on me but still I married him and we are still married now.</s>
        <s>We didn't divorce yet.</s>
        <s>If <name type="person">Jay</name> still loves me I will try my hardest to break up my marriage.</s>

        <s>Right now, it's just me and <name type="person">Jay</name>.</s>
        <s>When I look back he was the only one who ever loved me.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Tom</name> never really loved me.</s>
        <s>I was just a show off for him.</s>
        <s>But where was he all that time?</s>
        <s>All these 5 years.</s>
        <s>He was rich, but why did he never came to visit me.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Tom</name> could do nothing against him.</s>

        <s>I really wanna see <name type="person">Jay's</name> house.</s>
        <s>Maybe it can be a comfortable living place.</s>
        <s>I should ask <name type="person">Nick</name> how it looks.</s>
        <s>Or I should have asked <name type="person">Jordan</name>, since she is a real flapper.</s>
        <s>I don't think his house can be as big as mine.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Tom</name> is one of the richest person in <name type="geo">East Egg</name> and here is just <name type="geo">West Egg</name> where new wealthy people live.</s>
