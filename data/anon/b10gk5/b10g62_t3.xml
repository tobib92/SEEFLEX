        <s>The film is a very <choice><orig>helpfull</orig><reg>helpful</reg></choice> device to illustrate relations between the protagonist and a side-characters.</s>

        <s>It shows another way of understanding their emotions or thoughts besides reading a book.</s>

        <s>I personally wouldn't thought that he is so popular and cool, because the way the the movie and <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr's</ref> thoughts described him was really <choice><orig>suprising</orig><reg>surprising</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>One point that <choice><orig>suprised</orig><reg>surprised</reg></choice> me was his black behaviour.</s>
        <s>The book described him as a <choice><orig>priviledeg</orig><reg>privileged</reg></choice> white boy who also acts like one.</s>
        <s>But the movie symbolized for example his shoes with the help of medium shots or his headphones and his dancemoves.</s>
        <s>Not to forget his calm and cool way to deal with things way very <choice><orig>suprising</orig><reg>surprising</reg></choice>.</s>

        <s>But convincing to the impact on my teenage life, from my point of view the movie did a better job.</s>
        <s>Reasons for that are just the <choice><orig>illustratin</orig><reg>illustration</reg></choice> of the teenager in the movie.</s>
        <s>It is easier to identify with a person you see.</s>
        <s>The way they talked for example and the camera switches between the conversation felt very relatable for me.</s>
        <s>It helped a lot to put myself in their shoes and to feel with them.</s>
        <s>Furthermore a book can only describe relatable than an illustration of the problems.</s>
        <s>Additionally in the movie you see many things or props like a phone which are very familiar to our real world.</s>
