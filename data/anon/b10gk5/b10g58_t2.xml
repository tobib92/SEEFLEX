        <s>The given scene is a good example for characterizing <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Chris</orig><reg>Chris'</reg></choice></ref> personality because the director sets the focus on <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> and his relationship to <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref>.</s>

        <s>At the begin of the scene the director makes use of a medium close up, to set the focus on his facial impressions and his actions.</s>
        <s>In addition to that the camera is following him, this effect makes sure, that the viewers pay more attention on him.</s>

        <s>Furthermore there is a close up while the voice over from <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref>.</s>
        <s>The close up focuses on <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Chris</orig><reg>Chris'</reg></choice></ref> shoes, meanwhile <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> is talking about his <name type="misc">Jordans</name>.</s>
