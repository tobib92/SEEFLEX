        <s>But <choice><abbr>THUG</abbr><expan><ref target="b10gk5_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref></expan></choice> is a film, which supports the <name type="misc">black lives matter</name> movements very much and <choice><orig>show's</orig><reg>shows</reg></choice> how it feels to be in a difficult situation of a black girl.</s>
        <s>It <choice><orig>show's</orig><reg>shows</reg></choice> how a young girl doesn't give up and does everything to stop racism.</s>
