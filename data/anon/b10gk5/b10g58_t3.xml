      </p>
      <p>
        <s>First of all <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> important to say that it's about the way of story-telling, you could have a <choice><orig>verry</orig><reg>very</reg></choice> good story and a good message behind it, but if you don't know how to present it and the way you do, there will not be a big impact to the viewers.</s>

        <s>For example the film <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref> presented the topic of racism and <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> message on a good way.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>If we talk about the film we need to keep in mind that <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref> is not a documentary, so the film isn't supposed to show the effects on racism.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my point of view the film had a little impact on my perspective because of <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> brutal way of presenting the demonstrations from the black <choice><orig>lifes</orig><reg>lives</reg></choice> matter organisation.</s>
        <s>The film was still realistic and showed the risks and happenings of racism on a good but brutal way.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all the film has a good message and deals with the topic of racism very good even though it isn't a documentary.</s>
