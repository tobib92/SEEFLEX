        <s>I think that books have a big impact on <choice><orig>everyones</orig><reg>everyone's</reg></choice> life.</s>
        <s>They save information for <choice><orig>hundrets</orig><reg>hundreds</reg></choice> of years and can also change the perspectives or <choice><orig>lifes</orig><reg>lives</reg></choice> of their readers.</s>
        <s>In my opinion the movie <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref> <choice><orig>portrayes</orig><reg>portrays</reg></choice> the very important story, that <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="author">Thomas</ref> tells with her book very good.</s>
        <s>It showed me, that you should always speak up about things, because you are not the only one who suffers from them.</s>
        <s>If you <choice><orig>dont</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> speak up when something wrong happens, nothing will change and it's going to happen again and again, not just to you, but to other people too.</s>
        <s>The movie showed, that you shouldn't change who you are, but that you should fight for yourself and your rights.</s>
        <s>In my opinion the movie also shows, that many children or teenagers have to grow up way too fast and I think that's very unfair.</s>
