        <salute>Dear John</salute>

        <s>how are you?</s>
        <s>I read the text <ref target="a10gk4_2" type="title">Coffee to go</ref> and I try to answer your questions.</s>
        <s>In general, plastic coffee cups are popular in <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>
        <s>The people in <name type="geo">Germany</name> are throwing 2,8 <foreign xml:lang="de">Milliarden</foreign> plastic coffee cups away <foreign xml:lang="de">pro</foreign> year.</s>
        <s>Also the trash cans are in many <choice><orig>citys</orig><reg>cities</reg></choice> <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> full, that the people are throwing the cups on the ground.</s>
        <s>This is <choice><orig>conected</orig><reg>connected</reg></choice> to your second question.</s>
        <s>There are many problems with coffee cups in <name type="geo">Germany</name> like I said, the people are throwing them at the ground.</s>
        <s>This is pretty bad for the whole city.</s>
        <s>Moreover the <choice><orig>ressources</orig><reg>resources</reg></choice> that the <choice><orig>cups</orig><reg>cups'</reg></choice> costs are pretty high for 7,6 <choice><orig>Million</orig><reg>million</reg></choice> plastic cups, they need 22000 ton of oil, 1,5 <foreign xml:lang="de">Milliarden</foreign> liter water, 64000 ton of wood.</s>
        <s>I think the price is high for coffee cups, who are getting thrown away.</s>
        <s>Also it is not so good for nature.</s>
        <s>This is what the <name type="misc">Umwelthilfe</name> says.</s>
        <s>The cups are mostly used only for 15 minutes, before they get thrown away.</s>
        <s>So short for this high price.</s>
        <s>Another problem is, that the most of the cups can't reach the <choice><orig>Recyclingsystem</orig><reg>recycling system</reg></choice>, so they <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> be used again.</s>
        <s>Now I will answer your last question.</s>
        <s>They have alternatives, but they don't work so good.</s>
        <s>One of them is a cup, which can be refilled.</s>
        <s>The only problem is the space.</s>
        <s>It is much bigger than the plastic cups so it is not a coffee, more like a milk drink.</s>
        <s>The <quote>Unterwegsbecher</quote> is also not working well.</s>
        <s>It is hard to drink, while <choice><orig>your</orig><reg>you're</reg></choice> <choice><orig>caring</orig><reg>carrying</reg></choice> your stuff and the cup.</s>
        <s>The only different one is, to choose a time and sit on a bank and drink <choice><orig>coffe</orig><reg>coffee</reg></choice>, but I don't this it is a good <choice><orig>alternativ</orig><reg>alternative</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>I hope I helped you.</s>
        <s>If you ever need help with <choice><orig>somethink</orig><reg>something</reg></choice> like that, you can ask me.</s>
