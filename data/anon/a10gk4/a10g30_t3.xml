        <s>In the following I will comment on necessary as well as feasible measures to help solving the global pollution.</s>
        <s>Every single human being knows that the <choice><orig>enviromental</orig><reg>environmental</reg></choice> pollution is increasing and it is becoming dangerous for human health, as well as for animals and plants.</s>
        <s>The question is, what can we do to help?</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Firstly, it can be said that everyone has to <choice><orig>seperate</orig><reg>separate</reg></choice> their trash.</s>
        <s>Some people might say that it is not going to change anything but if everyone works together it is going to have a huge impact.</s>
        <s>Secondly, we should start using sustainable and recycable products, for example clothes, and technical devices to prevent the pollution of the ocean and particular regions.</s>
        <s>Lastly, people should start using electronical vehicles, <add>(even if they are more expensive)</add>, so that the pollution of the air decreases and human health is not in big danger anymore.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all it can be said, that if everyone on planet earth starts by doing the bare minimum for our <choice><orig>enviroment</orig><reg>environment</reg></choice>, the mass extinction of animals, plants and eventually humans can be stopped.</s>
