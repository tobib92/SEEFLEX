        <s>In the following text I will give you information about my opinion.</s>
        <s>I think also that exchanges can break down walls between <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> but it has advantages and disadvantages.</s>

        <s>On the other hand I think like <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> that is important to know more about the other <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> and people with other <choice><orig>culturen</orig><reg>cultures</reg></choice> <choice><orig>comes</orig><reg>come</reg></choice> together.</s>
