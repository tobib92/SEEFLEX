        <s>As stated in the summary the speech from <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> is about the importance of intercultural understanding and student exchanges.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Now I will analyse the structure and the stylistic devices from the given extract.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>At the beginning of his speech he makes his intention clear by saying <quote>And I came to Turkey because...</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 1)</ref>, so the listener knows why he gave a speech directly.</s>
        <s>In addition he uses alliteration because he says <quote>mutual interest and mutual respect</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 2-3)</ref> this put the importance of acceptance outside.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><choice><orig>Than</orig><reg>Then</reg></choice> he uses <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> alliteration again by saying <quote>I've seen it in...</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 4)</ref> and <quote>I saw it in...</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 5)</ref> this makes clear that he <choice><orig>see</orig><reg>sees</reg></choice> many positive effects of intercultural understanding.</s>
        <s>So the listeners <choice><orig>thinks</orig><reg>think</reg></choice> that this can work.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>At the ending of uses alliteration he says <quote>Everywhere</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 7)</ref> to bring to a close.</s>
        <s>This <choice><orig>have</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> also a positive effect to the listener.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Then he uses personal pronouns like <quote>us</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 13)</ref> and <quote>we</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 14)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This <choice><orig>give</orig><reg>gives</reg></choice> a feeling that everyone, <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> too, is a part of this project.</s>
        <s><quote>we're joined together</quote><ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 15)</ref> makes this feeling of community also clear again.</s>
        <s>But this also <choice><orig>put</orig><reg>puts</reg></choice> the importance of supporting outside because only together you can change it.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the ending of his speech he <choice><orig>speak</orig><reg>speaks</reg></choice> to the listener by saying <quote>So to all of you</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 18)</ref> this also makes the importance of his goals clear.</s>
        <s>And so he <choice><orig>get</orig><reg>gets</reg></choice> also the attention again.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Then he <choice><orig>appeal</orig><reg>appeals</reg></choice> to everyone by saying <quote>I want you to know that the world will be what you make of it</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 18)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This makes the listener to think of that.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The last sentence is a promise that <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> <choice><orig>give</orig><reg>gives</reg></choice> the people to encourage them <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 21-22)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So you can say in <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker"><choice><orig>Obamas</orig><reg>Obama's</reg></choice></ref> speech he <choice><orig>encourage</orig><reg>encourages</reg></choice> the listeners and he makes the importance of his speech clear.</s>
