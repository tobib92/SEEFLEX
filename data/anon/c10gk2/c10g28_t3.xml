        <s>To begin with I would like to clearly position myself next to <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> who phrases the mentioned quote.</s>
        <s>I think losing our little differences is the only way our world can move further.</s>
        <s>As <name type="person">Michelle Obama</name> says intercultural exchanges are the <quote>key to success</quote>.</s>

        <s>Food is something everybody connects.</s>
        <s>It can be discussed whether it's delicious or not and now it's made which is a great way to lose problems.</s>

        <s>To sum up I would like to say how right <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> is when he formulates such a saying.</s>
        <s>Simple exchanges as food e.g. are what makes us lose our differences.</s>
