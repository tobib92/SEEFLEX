        <s>In the following, I will comment on that opinion.</s>

      <p>
        <s>First of all, student exchanges help to understand each other's cultural values better.</s>
        <s>Getting past stereotypes and prejudices is an advantage, no one could deny.</s>

        <s>Even if some exchange students make bad experiences abroad, the majority won't.</s>

        <s>Our world is as connected as never before.</s>
        <s>Globalization and the internet, influence our life everyday.</s>
        <s>Cross-cultural experiences like meditation in <name type="geo">Europe</name> or <name type="geo">America</name> are normal.</s>

        <s>So, I truely think, we should <quote>learn [more] new languages</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 10)</ref> to be fully connected.</s>
        <s>A <quote>simple exchange</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 13)</ref> will <choice><orig>defenetly</orig><reg>definitely</reg></choice> guarantee you an improving in your language skills.</s>

      <p>
        <s>After <choice><orig>wheighing</orig><reg>weighing</reg></choice> and comparing both sides, I think we can agree with <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> that <quote>simple exchanges can break down walls</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 13)</ref> between different cultures because you are able to get a better understanding on each other's traditions and values.</s>
