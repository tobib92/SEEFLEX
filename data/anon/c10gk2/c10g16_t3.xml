        <s>In his speech <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> said <quote>Simple exchanges can break down walls between us</quote>.</s>

        <s>At first: reasons why yes.</s>
        <s>Of course exchanges are a good way to find new friends in other countries.</s>
        <s>You can say thousands of benefits.</s>
        <s>Or how <name type="person">Michelle Obama</name> said <quote>It's better to travel ten thousands of kilometres than reading ten thousand of books</quote>.</s>

        <s>What I want to say is that not only the friendships are better than also the own personality is much stronger after an exchange.</s>

        <s>In the other hand you can say that exchanges are <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> short to getting new friend for a life.</s>
        <s>A good example against is my own mother: When she was 16 she made a 1 month exchange to <name type="geo">Plerain</name> <add>(<choice><abbr>FR</abbr><expan>France</expan></choice>)</add> and her host family is still today, 30 years later in near contact with her.</s>
        <s>They can't see another <choice><orig>ofden</orig><reg>often</reg></choice> but they call another and still writing letters and <choice><orig>E-mails</orig><reg>e-mails</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>This is a perfect example for a long relationship of to friends.</s>
