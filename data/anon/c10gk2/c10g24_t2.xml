        <s>I'd like to analyse the speech from <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Barack Obama</ref>.</s>

      <p>
        <s>The text is structured in four sections.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the first section, line 1-3, <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> says that he wants to build a relationship between Muslim people and the United States.</s>
        <s>This makes clear, that he doesn't <choice><orig>wants</orig><reg>want</reg></choice> <choice><orig>arguements</orig><reg>arguments</reg></choice> between other cultures.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the second section, line 4-12, he talks about the new spirit of activism and responsibility and that he's proud of it <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 4)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This shows us, that <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> is proud of his country and that he loves the people there.</s>
        <s>He makes an example where he says that he saw it in his own presidential campaign, where young people provided the energy and the idealism that made effort possible <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 5-7)</ref>.</s>
        <s>He wants to say, that not only young people in his presidential campaign can do this.</s>
        <s>Also other young people all over the world.</s>
        <s>The president also says that he wants to connect young Americans to young people from all over the world to learn new languages, do an exchange or make new friends <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 9-11)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This underlines, that you could do a lot when you are connected to people from other <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the third section, he says it would be nice for everyone because we can break down walls between us <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 13-14)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This is a little bit exaggerated because he makes recruitment to make an exchange year.</s>
        <s>With the sentence <quote>We are reminded that we are joined together by our pursuit...</quote> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 14-15)</ref> he says that our time to connect the world is now.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The last section he also makes recruitment that the world is, what we make of it and that we could decide what our <choice><orig>prosperitys</orig><reg>prosperities</reg></choice> are <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 18-20)</ref>.</s>
        <s>He makes clear that he would love it when we will find new friends from the <name type="geo">United States</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The president gets the readers because of his exaggerated kind of speech.</s>
