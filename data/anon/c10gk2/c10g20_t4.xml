        <s>The importance of student exchanges has been discussed a lot in the past.</s>

        <s><name type="person">Bianca</name> is an 18-year-old German volunteer who worked in an <name type="misc">Education Center</name> for <choice><orig>childrin</orig><reg>children</reg></choice>, located in a slum of <name type="geo">Delhi</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>During her time in <name type="geo">Delhi</name>, she usually stood up early at 8:30 <choice><abbr>am</abbr><expan>ante meridiem</expan></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>She mentions, the best thing of the exchange were the children who were full of acceptance and full of love.</s>
        <s>This was especially astonishing, as children in <name type="geo">Germany</name> never acted like this.</s>
        <s>Furthermore the children in the slums didn't live under good conditions.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>At the end of the day, it was an experience with love, hope, confidence, patience and a lot of gratitude.</s>
        <s>She owes all of this to the children.</s>
