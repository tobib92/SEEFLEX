        <s>I'll comment the statement that <quote>simple exchanges can break down walls between us</quote>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>First of all I guess <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> makes clear, that making <choice><orig>frieds</orig><reg>friends</reg></choice> from other <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> will be nice.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>When you make friends from other <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> you'll be connected with people who <choice><orig>has</orig><reg>have</reg></choice> an other way of <choice><orig>live</orig><reg>life</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>So you could learn something about other cultures like what they eat.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Another point is that you could learn other languages from your friends like <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> which we learn in <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> schools and maybe you get better in school because you learn the language from your friend.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>You could also go abroad to do an exchange year, work and travel or something like this.</s>
        <s>When you are already connected to people from other <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> you may don't feel alone in your exchange year.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion I guess <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama's</ref> statement is right because most people go on holidays to other <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> and that doesn't break the walls but when you are a long time in another country to visit your friends you feel home and this could break the walls.</s>
