        <s>The article you send me from our school <choice><orig>hompage</orig><reg>homepage</reg></choice> is about the project <name type="misc">School B goes green</name>.</s>

      <p>
        <s>This why is a day in <date>November 2019</date>, when we had a whole day just to concern ourselves with environmental protection.</s>
        <s>This day was created because of <name type="misc">Fridays for Future</name> and the growing interest of the students.</s>
        <s>Some of the students were also going to the demonstrations and we're not at school on <choice><orig>fridays</orig><reg>Fridays</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>To show these people that they also can do something to make the school sustainable.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Therefore multiple workshops about different topics were offered.</s>
        <s>For example about food sharing or a second-hand clothes.</s>
        <s>Me for example.</s>
        <s>I was at the town hall and talked with politicians about environmental protection in <name type="geo">Cologne</name>.</s>
        <s>At the end of the day everybody listened to two poets, who also did the workshop.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Everybody was really contended about this day and one of them who organized the day, Mr. Smith, said it was really good and maybe something to do again.</s>
        <s>I agree to that, but at the moment it is not possible to do something like that because of the pandemic.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope I could help you!</s>
