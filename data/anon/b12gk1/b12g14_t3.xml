        <s>my name is Jane and I want to express my feelings about your speech in <date>2021</date> at the climate summit in <name type="geo">Glasgow</name> towards you.</s>

        <s>Then you said it is possible to stop the climate change and if you do not act the following generations will be angry.</s>
        <s>He said he will not let us down.</s>
        <s>But in my opinion you let us down.</s>
        <s>You and your colleagues were responsible to change something!</s>
        <s>You had the chance to stop global warming and climate change.</s>
        <s>But if we look how it is right now, we have to say it is worse than ever before: <choice><orig>tornados</orig><reg>tornadoes</reg></choice>, flood disasters, heat, climate <choice><orig>refugies</orig><reg>refugees</reg></choice>, pandemics and so on.</s>
        <s>These are consequences the scientists of your time warrant you and your colleagues of.</s>
        <s>But you just thought about the next elections and you were scared of the economy and its influence.</s>
        <s>As you said the following generations ARE angry!</s>
        <s>You are responsible for all the pain in this world, but WE have to live with that.</s>
        <s>Think about that.</s>
