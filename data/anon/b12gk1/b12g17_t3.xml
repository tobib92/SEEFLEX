        <salute>Dear Mr. Johnson,</salute>

        <s>your predictions could not have been more right.</s>
        <s>If <name type="misc">COP26</name> would not have worked out, we would now have droughts all over the world and rising sea levels which take our homes, such as floodings.</s>
        <s>Cheap productions were exploiting workers and destroying their homes.</s>
        <s>The arctic would be gone by now and thousands of species would have been <choice><orig>aliminated</orig><reg>eliminated</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>The technology and the <choice><orig>knowlague</orig><reg>knowledge</reg></choice> to fight global warming were already given and it just needed someone to open their eyes and show the urgency.</s>
        <s>I do not want to imagine what would have happened if the temperature would be rising above 2 degrees Celsius.</s>
        <s>We would have dried out crops and no more drinking water.</s>
        <s>But thanks to you we noe have green energy production such as wind turbines and solar panels and electric cars.</s>
        <s>Thanks to you we can breath fresh air and walk in nicely temperature weather.</s>
