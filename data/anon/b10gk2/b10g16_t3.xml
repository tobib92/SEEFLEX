        <s>I liked the movie <ref target="b10gk2_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref>, because I think that it gave a good impression of <ref target="b10gk2_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> life and feelings, that probably many other people have in a similar way.</s>
        <s>It also made me realize how lucky I am, that I live in <name type="geo">Germany</name> where less of this happens and I personally don't have to deal with those problems.</s>
        <s>But it also showed me, that also in <name type="geo">Germany</name> there is racism, especially unconscious racism, and how much of a problem it is, because I saw the reactions to it and that it even destroyed a good friendship.</s>
        <s>I think that the movie made me more aware and sensitive for racism.</s>
