        <s>There is the discussion if works of the English poet <ref target="c12lk2_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> should still be taught in German English classes.</s>
        <s>There are people who say that reading poetry that is more than 400 years old would not make sense but I do not agree with that.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><ref target="c12lk2_1" type="author">William Shakespeare</ref> had a huge influence on literature and English language.</s>
        <s>Through reading his works we better can understand the modern world and what it is like to be a human being.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In addition <ref target="c12lk2_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> invented more than 1500 words and phrases.</s>
        <s>We can learn very much from him.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Another advantage of dealing with <ref target="c12lk2_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> is that reading his sometimes hard language is challenging and inspiring too.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>However, I personally think that teaching works of <ref target="c12lk2_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> in German English classes still is important.</s>
        <s>There are so many things we can learn from him that it really would make sense for students to read his works.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>the fact that the topics <ref target="c12lk2_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> wrote about continued to be relevant still today is an argument too.</s>
