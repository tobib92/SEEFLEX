        <s>In my opinion <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> should still be taught in German English class because he is still relevant in our time.</s>
        <s>He was ahead of its time when it comes to his literature because he discussed topics which everyone could relate to, and the way people 400 years later can still understand.</s>
        <s>He brings to the point what it is to be human.</s>
        <s>Added to that <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> created 1700 words, which are partly still used till this day.</s>

      <p>
        <s>In his plays, poems and sonnets he talks or displays themes that will always be talked about no matter how old society gets.</s>
