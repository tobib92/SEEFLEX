        <s><name type="person">Shakespeare</name> was not only a very talented author but also he made up over 700 new words for the English language.</s>
        <s>Of course <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> is written in <date>1600</date> which is over 400 years in the past, but his plays and sonnets still fill in the new time and still help a lot of people.</s>
        <s>Also some very known sentences we use on a daily basis are lines <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> made up in his plays or his sonnets.</s>
        <s>For sure it could be difficult for students to understand the old texts and some of them maybe hate <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> but it is some sort of knowledge which everybody should have.</s>
        <s>Especially when we use his queotes on a daily basis.</s>
        <s>To <choice><orig>summerise</orig><reg>summarise</reg></choice> all the arguments, I still am for Shakespeare in English classes although it is very old, you can learn something over your current language and over everything you do.</s>
