        <s>The novel impacted me and my perspective in many ways.</s>
        <s><ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Starr</ref> is shown as a small teenaged girl in the first part of the novel, who goes to a <choice><orig>privileget</orig><reg>privileged</reg></choice> school and doesn't <choice><orig>has</orig><reg>have</reg></choice> much to say.</s>
        <s>But the fact, that <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Starr</ref> gains the power only with the huge willing to change the world, <choice><orig>whith</orig><reg>with</reg></choice> fighting against racism, shows, that teenagers can change the <choice><orig>word</orig><reg>world</reg></choice> <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice>.</s>

        <s>The novel <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref>, shows that it's not hopeless to do something against something even if you are just one human, what <choice><orig>effected</orig><reg>affected</reg></choice> me in that way, that I also don't have a <choice><orig>hopless</orig><reg>hopeless</reg></choice> view on actions like that, because the start <choice><orig>smal</orig><reg>small</reg></choice>, but can become very big.</s>

      <p>
        <s>As a conclusion I can say, that the novel <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref> changed my perspective in that way, that everyone can start something big, like <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Starr</ref> did in the novel and it doesn't matter, in which age you are, what high you have or what your nationality is.</s>
