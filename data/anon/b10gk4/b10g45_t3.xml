        <s><choice><orig>Wich</orig><reg>Which</reg></choice> impact had the film <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref> on me?</s>
        <s>While I watched the film I was confused and angry about the fact that the police officer wasn't arrested.</s>
        <s>The sentence of <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Starr's</ref> dad stayed in my head.</s>
        <s>He said that it is like a <choice><orig>circal</orig><reg>circle</reg></choice>, because of someone is poor they need quick money for paying food or a house.</s>
        <s>He just <choice><orig>get</orig><reg>gets</reg></choice> a good payed job, if he had a good education, but he can't <choice><orig>efford</orig><reg>afford</reg></choice> that, so he stays poor and so do his kids.</s>
        <s>If you are born poor, you stay poor.</s>
        <s>What I also remember is the fact that <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Starr</ref> has two different <choice><orig>personallity</orig><reg>personality</reg></choice> <choice><orig>trades</orig><reg>traits</reg></choice> at school and at home, to doesn't give anyone a reason to fight with her.</s>

        <s>All in all the film really opens the <choice><orig>viewers</orig><reg>viewer's</reg></choice> eyes and it has an important message: To speak up and don't stay silent because it's the only way to change something.</s>
