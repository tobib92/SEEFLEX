        <s>The book had a huge impact on me and probably generally an impact for every reader, because it is so popular and <choice><orig>sucessful</orig><reg>successful</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>The story is really interesting and realistic at the same time.</s>
        <s>Normally I don't like to read books, but this one catched me and teached me a lot about racism.</s>
        <s>Before I have just heard much about racism <choice><orig>storys</orig><reg>stories</reg></choice>, after I have finally read this one, I can better imagine how unjust racism is, I learned that there is no reason to be a racist, there never was one.</s>
        <s>I have only one critic, namely in the film is a scene where <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Starr</ref> scares <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Hailey</ref> with a hairbrush, because she acts racism, she deserved it for sure, but the problem is that, <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Starr</ref> was presented as the violent attacker and <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Hailey</ref> as the victim, so the black girl is again the attacker, whereas in this sequence the white girl <ref target="b10gk4_1" type="character">Hailey</ref> should it be.</s>
        <s>Apart from that the book is excellent.</s>
