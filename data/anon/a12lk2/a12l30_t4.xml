        <salute>Hi John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I have found an article that might be interesting for the essay you told me about.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The article was released on <date>April 23rd 2016</date> by the <name type="misc">MÃ¤rkische Allgemeine Zeitung</name>, a local <name type="geo">Brandenburg</name> newspaper which seems to be reputable.</s>
        <s>In the article producers from <name type="geo">Brandenburg</name> theatres are interviewed and asked why the still portray <name type="person">Shakespeare's</name> plays.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It is stated that <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> is still of great relevance as his works get the audience's interest through suprises and portray his characters as human <add>e.g. in the form of weak heroes or strong women</add> making his works truly unique.</s>
        <s>Furthermore it is stated that his works reach a broad audience with comic elements in tragedies and tragic elements in comedies making each play interesting for a bigger demographic.</s>
        <s>Furthermore <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> has just written so much that you can't get around his works.</s>
        <s>They have been translated in over 100 languages there are even different German translations from different eras.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The article also states that <name type="person">Shakespeare's</name> works have remained so relevant as nothing else was able to portray the humanness of the feeling and characters as well as his poetry.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Shakespeare</name> is compared to <name type="person">Bach</name> and <name type="person">Michelangelo</name> who helped shape their artform.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Anyways I hope I could help you if you have any questions regarding the article feel free to contact me.</s>
