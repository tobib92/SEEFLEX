        <salute>Dear Mr. Shakespeare,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>it was a pleasure receiving your letter and I feel honored you sent me one of your sonnets.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think this sonnet has a special meaning.</s>
        <s>It can be transferred to many different parts of life because the theme of transitoriness is present everywhere.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It made me think about my life and how I should enjoy it.</s>
        <s>As all your sonnets it caused different emotions and let me doubt about my way of living before.</s>
        <s>You made me understand that I want to live my youth before I wilt like the flower.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think you should publish this sonnet because it could be an inspiration for everyone.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It can be interpreted differently in different times, at different places by different people and become inspiration to <choice><orig>completly</orig><reg>completely</reg></choice> new works of art.</s>
        <s>Maybe in the future the people will love your work too and turn it into something <choice><orig>completly</orig><reg>completely</reg></choice> new.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think what you are doing is art and you should not keep your talent a secret.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope you are taking my advice and think about publishing them.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <signed>Best wishes, Jane</signed>
