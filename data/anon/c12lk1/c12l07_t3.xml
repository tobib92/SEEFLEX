        <s>I think <ref target="c12lk1_1" type="title">Sonnet 65</ref> is a very convincing sonnet that showed really good huh <ref target="c12lk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> felt about the change.</s>
        <s>You could see clearly how much he liked the time before the <name type="person">Dark Lady</name>.</s>
        <s>He described it with summer, and pointed out how much she loved it a lot of times.</s>
        <s>He called this time the best jewel, which is also very convincing because he was a rich man back then.</s>
        <s>He probably owned some jewels but none of them was as beautiful as the time he called <quote>summer</quote>.</s>
        <s>It is very often underlined, how brutal the change to winter, so to the Elizabethan time was, which probably convinced people to start thinking differently about <name type="person">Queen Elizabeth</name>.</s>
        <s>I am sure some people did not think about what a huge difference this change would make.</s>
        <s>I also think a lot of people thought about how good the time before was, because <ref target="c12lk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> describe it so beautiful.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So I think <ref target="c12lk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> did a great job telling people how he was thinking about it but also made an impact on the people and on their mindset.</s>
