        <s>So the teachers in <name type="geo">Germany</name> think that chess has positive effects on the concentration, the logical and strategical thinking.</s>
        <s>About a year ago there was a <choice><orig>Turnament</orig><reg>tournament</reg></choice> in the central of the city <name type="geo">Bremen</name>, where 1000 pupils who had 1 hour of school lesson per week as training played against each other.</s>
        <s>In this year 2400 elementary school pupils in <name type="geo">Bremen</name> got 1 hour per week as <quote>chess lesson</quote> <name type="geo">Bremen</name> is the leading city of school chess in <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>

      <p>
        <s>72% of teachers said the pupils are happy and enjoy to play 1 hour of chess per week.</s>
        <s>23% said that the kids also play in their free time.</s>
        <s>But why chess?</s>
        <s>Nearly half of the pedagogues expected that logical and strategical thinking will benefit from it, 37%, expected that concentration and the social life in class gets better.</s>
        <s>Nearly every teacher got his expectations fulfilled.</s>
        <s>Scientist <name type="person">Iris Krimet</name> also said that good players get bored and bad players lose their lust to play.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Nina Helmer</name> says that she got forced to play chess in the <name type="geo">Soviet Union</name> in school and that a result in that could be that a hate develops.</s>
        <s>Some positive effects are learning consequences in your choices, stick to rules, and learning to lose says <name type="geo">GÃ¼nther Klemm</name>.</s>
        <s>Younger pupils can beat older ones and bad ones can under circumstances beat the better ones.</s>
        <s>In the last lessons at a school day naturally the concentration is not as high.</s>
        <s>There is one school in <name type="geo">Hamburg</name> where chess is forced to play 1 hour a week.</s>
        <s>In second grade chess is replaced with Arts or Music, in 3rd grade with Math and in 4th grade with German.</s>
        <s>In 10 years of experience with chess at school, <name type="person">Gabriele Rietow</name> says that the lesson has positive impacts on the general learning, the communication between older and younger pupils and social behavior and the concentration.</s>
        <s>There is a difference, even though girls are equally as good as boys they don't attend <choice><orig>Turnaments</orig><reg>tournaments</reg></choice> as often as the <choice><orig>Boys</orig><reg>boys</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Rietow</name> said boys want to compete and compare each other more than girls do.</s>
