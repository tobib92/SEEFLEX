        <salute>Dear Todd!</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I heard you're thinking of spending a year in <name type="geo">Germany</name> and I think that's great!</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I've found an article by <ref target="a12gk2_2" type="author">Marina Kormbaki</ref> which is called <ref target="a12gk2_2" type="title">Berlin spricht Englisch</ref> and appeared on <date>15th July 2016</date> in the newspaper <name type="misc">Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung</name>.</s>
        <s>It might really convince you of <name type="geo">Berlin</name>!</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The article says that now not only English-speaking tourists but also English-speaking immigrants come to <name type="geo">Berlin</name> more and more.</s>
        <s>The reason for that is that <name type="geo">Berlin</name> has developed into a world open <foreign xml:lang="de">metropole</foreign> which can be compared to <name type="geo">London</name> or <name type="geo">Los Angeles</name> according to the article.</s>
        <s><name type="geo">Berlin</name> is described as <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> own bubble which is independent from the rest of <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>
        <s>Another aspect given in the article is that in <name type="geo">Berlin</name> already many enterprises are lead internationally so the language spoken there is English as well.</s>
        <s>And it's nothing new for the <name type="geo">Berlin</name> people to hear many other languages due to many <choice><orig>turkish</orig><reg>Turkish</reg></choice> and <choice><orig>arabic</orig><reg>Arabic</reg></choice> immigrants.</s>
        <s>A big advantage is also that compared to other <choice><orig>metropoles</orig><reg>metropolises</reg></choice> <name type="geo">Berlin</name> is rather cheap; for example <name type="geo">Dublin</name> is much more expensive.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion I would say that <name type="geo">Berlin</name> is the best place for an <choice><orig>English speaking</orig><reg>English-speaking</reg></choice> person to be in <name type="geo">Germany</name> and I would <choice><orig>definetly</orig><reg>definitely</reg></choice> recommend it for you to live there.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Hope to see you soon, maybe in <name type="geo">Berlin</name>.</s>
