        <s>According to him language studying is in a decline which is <choice><orig>particulary</orig><reg>particularly</reg></choice> visible in high level parts of the education system.</s>
        <s>Moreover universities, the <name type="misc">GCSE</name> and the <name type="misc">A-Levels</name>.</s>
        <s>Despite recent efforts of implementing languages in primary schools the <name type="geo">UK</name> is having a long way to catch up.</s>
        <s><ref target="a12gk2_1" type="author">Worne</ref> sees the reason in <choice><orig>neglegence</orig><reg>negligence</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>With English <choice><orig>beeing</orig><reg>being</reg></choice> the <choice><orig>worldlanguage</orig><reg>world language</reg></choice> and the reliance on translators like <name type="misc">iPhones</name> learning foreign languages seems obsolete.</s>
        <s>He thinks that an integrated <choice><orig>programm</orig><reg>program</reg></choice> for language learning is a key in facilitating the <name type="geo">UK's</name> role in the globalized world.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>Furthermor</orig><reg>Furthermore</reg></choice> it can achieve goals that no translator can like expanding into non-English speaking markets and avoiding technical issues like ineffective roaming data.</s>
        <s>Giving professionals an extra langauge skill besides English makes them more efficient and therefore more desired.</s>
        <s>The recent implementation of such <choice><orig>programms</orig><reg>programs</reg></choice> by universities pleases him.</s>

        <s>So overall <ref target="a12gk2_1" type="author">Worne</ref> sees the <name type="geo">UK</name> in a backward position when regarding language learning.</s>

        <s><ref target="a12gk2_1" type="author">Worne</ref> himself thinks negatively towards this trend and is pushing for more emphasis among parents to support the school system's current efforts.</s>
