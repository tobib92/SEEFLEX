        <s>According to <ref target="a12gk2_1" type="author">Worne</ref> since seven years fewer and fewer students are willing to study foreign languages at university level.</s>
        <s>Although more primary schools teach foreign languages the exam results have <choice><orig>stacknated</orig><reg>stagnated</reg></choice>, and the number of exams has declined since <date>1990</date>, while there was even an increase before <date>1990</date>.</s>
        <s>Since many people think the ability to speak foreign languages is getting less important, because of reasons like smart tech or the fact that <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> is an international language, <ref target="a12gk2_1" type="author">Worne</ref> states that he thinks this is completely wrong.</s>
        <s>The reason for his opinion is that most of the <name type="geo">UK</name>  businesses need foreign language skills.</s>
        <s>Hence, the lack of such skills results in dependence and less growth.</s>
