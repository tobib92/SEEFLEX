        <s>As written before, the novel <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="title">Gun Love</ref> by <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="author">Jennifer Clement</ref>, published in <date>2019</date> is about the story of <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> and her mother <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref>.</s>

      <p>
        <s><ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> and <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref> are living since 14 years in bad conditions in a <name type="misc">Mercury</name> in the trailer park in <name type="geo">Florida</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Now I want to analyse if the <choice><abbr>CPS</abbr><expan>Child Protective Service</expan></choice> should have taken <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> away from <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref>, to bring her into a foster home.</s>

        <s>On the one <choice><orig>Hand</orig><reg>hand</reg></choice> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> is everything for <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref>, so if you would take her away you take a big part from <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref> away.</s>
        <s>So that <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref> doesn't get happy anymore.</s>
        <s>But on the other <choice><orig>Hand</orig><reg>hand</reg></choice> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> is a very intelligent student and likes to go to school.</s>

        <s>So if the <choice><abbr>CPS</abbr><expan>Child Protective Service</expan></choice> would put her into a foster home she can <choice><orig>affort</orig><reg>afford</reg></choice> her dream of a chair and a desk and she has better <choice><orig>oppertunities</orig><reg>opportunities</reg></choice> of getting a good job in the future.</s>
        <s>When we have a look on the American Dream you can notice that it is very hard to get in the upper class, when you born in a poor family.</s>
        <s>But if <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> <choice><orig>start</orig><reg>starts</reg></choice> a new life now her chance of getting a good job with much money is much higher as when she <choice><orig>wait</orig><reg>waits</reg></choice> until she gets older.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>But if you look with another view on this situation you can't be sure if she doesn't like it in the trailer park.</s>
        <s>Maybe she <choice><orig>love</orig><reg>loves</reg></choice> it there and wants to <choice><orig>life</orig><reg>live</reg></choice> there forever.</s>

        <s>She needs to play with others and communicate with more people in her age.</s>
        <s>If she goes in a foster home she will make contacts to other children with the same age like her.</s>
        <s>And if something would happen to <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref> she is safe.</s>
        <s>She could live a child life without fear.</s>
