        <s>Very important is that <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> <choice><orig>behave</orig><reg>behaves</reg></choice> in the movie and novel in the same way because that's that what he has told in his children in an earlier scene.</s>
        <s>If he wouldn't behave like that it's shown that it depends on the police officer if you get shot and not on your behaviour.</s>
        <s><ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Khalil</ref> doesn't behave like <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> what could be a reason why <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">115</ref> <choice><orig>shots</orig><reg>shoots</reg></choice> him.</s>
        <s>It's still should not be a reason to shoot somebody because he doesn't behave like he is told to but because of racism it is.</s>
        <s>The details the <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> has the discussion with <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">King</ref> and not with someone else like in the novel is not that important because that doesn't <choice><orig>effect</orig><reg>affect</reg></choice> <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> behaviour.</s>

      <p>
        <s>To conclude the scene is faithful enough to the novel in my opinion because the details are different but the important part, how <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> <choice><orig>behave</orig><reg>behaves</reg></choice>, is the same.</s>
