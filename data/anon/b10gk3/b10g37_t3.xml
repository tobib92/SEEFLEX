        <s>In my opinion, the movie's version is also <choice><orig>faithfull</orig><reg>faithful</reg></choice> because the clear change of the atmosphere is very good demonstrated.</s>
        <s>In the movie the scene is at the restaurant with the <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Carter's</ref> family but the <q>pull-over</q> of <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> is basically the same.</s>
        <s>He stays polite and tries to protect his family in each way possible.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think it is not important who argues with <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref>.</s>
        <s>The important point is that <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> did the same thing as he told his kids to do, if the police pulls you over.</s>
        <s>In my opinion it is nice to see how the family fights for each other to protect <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> and everyone else.</s>

      <p>
        <s>Both versions have the same purpose/function for the story and demonstrate police violence especially of a black cop.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In summary one can say that the movie's version is still <choice><orig>faithfull</orig><reg>faithful</reg></choice> because it has the same effect on the story.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I prefer the movie's version over the version in the novel because the <choice><orig>cohension</orig><reg>cohesion</reg></choice>, the violence and the danger is better demonstrated.</s>
