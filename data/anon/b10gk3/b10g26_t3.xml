        <s>The sequence of the movie and the same scene in the novel, written by <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="author">Angie Thomas</ref> and published <date>2017</date>, have many differences.</s>
        <s>Such as the dinner, <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Kings</orig><reg>King's</reg></choice></ref> appearance and the reason why the polcie stepped in.</s>
        <s>All of this makes the same scene seeming like two.</s>
        <s>But in my opinion the message they want to tell the viewer/reader stays the same.</s>
        <s>That in this novel/film the police isn't an ally.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Of course can you say, that the scene takes place on another location or that there were some aspects added which weren't in the novel or simply changed.</s>
        <s>But my opinion <choice><orig>stay</orig><reg>stays</reg></choice> the same.</s>
        <s>If I had to mention <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> aspect which has gone missing it would be <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mr. Lewis</ref>.</s>
        <s>That's because when he snitched on <choice><abbr>TV</abbr><expan>television</expan></choice> we can see <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> and <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Mavericks</orig><reg>Maverick's</reg></choice></ref> reaction and the reader understands why <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Starr</ref> won't give an interview for <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Khalil</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>My final statement is, that I do think that the movie's version is still faithful enough to the novel's purpose.</s>
