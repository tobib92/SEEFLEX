        <s>As most of you know globalised environmental polluting is a current global issue caused by us humans.</s>
        <s>In the following I am going to comment on this thesis.</s>

      <p>
        <s>First of all the environment gets worse every year.</s>
        <s>There are many causes for this and the cause are our <choice><orig>humans</orig><reg>humans'</reg></choice> actions.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The biggest impact on this are the <choice><abbr>CO2</abbr><expan>carbon dioxide</expan></choice> emissions caused by our traffic and also our synthetic detergents, nitrogen fertilizers.</s>
        <s>Giving an example on <date>December 3, 1984</date> at <name type="geo">Bhopal</name> as a result of toxic and poisonous leakage over 2000 people were killed and hundreds severely hurt.</s>

        <s>We human beings losing control and become victims of our own creations.</s>
        <s>The rapidly urbanization and rapidly increasing industrialization is in turn a product of our advancement in science and technology.</s>
        <s>As you know it is the extinction of our flora and fauna.</s>
        <s>There are many races that do not exist anymore.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To put it in a nutshell it is important that we humans should be aware of our actions and try to stop the polluting.</s>
        <s>If not, there will no longer be a world for us to live.</s>
