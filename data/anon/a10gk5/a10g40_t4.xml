        <salute>Hi Carlos,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I recently have read about the losers of globalisation.</s>
        <s>As I know, you are an advocate of free trade and free market.</s>
        <s>So I wanted to make you aware of the loses people in poor countries in <name type="geo"><choice><orig>asia</orig><reg>Asia</reg></choice></name> make.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Have you ever thought about the life of the losers of globalisation and how they might feel.</s>
        <s>In the article I read there were three <choice><orig>fashionbloggers</orig><reg>fashion bloggers</reg></choice> from <name type="geo">Europe</name> and trying the work in <name type="geo"><choice><orig>Kambodscha</orig><reg>Cambodia</reg></choice></name>.</s>
        <s>They get shocked and also feel guilty.</s>
        <s>You also have heard of the pain but they state being there is something else.</s>
        <s>People there sit for hours doing the same work repeating it.</s>
        <s>If you compare those Europeans with the people there they are the same people inside.</s>
        <s>If we live in a capitalistic world and we are rich then other people have the cost to live a poor <choice><orig>live</orig><reg>life</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>I think you should try this out to earn some experiences and be aware of the losers of globalisation.</s>
