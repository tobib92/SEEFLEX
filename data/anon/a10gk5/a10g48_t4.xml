        <salute>Dear Carlos,</salute>

        <s>How are you?</s>
        <s>I hope you're doing well.</s>
        <s>I know how fond you are of the globalisation.</s>
        <s>I know that you support the free trade and free market it enables.</s>
        <s>However, I feel the need to inform you of the dark side of globalisation.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I read an article about three <choice><orig>norwegian</orig><reg>Norwegian</reg></choice> <choice><orig>fashionbloggers</orig><reg>fashion bloggers</reg></choice> being sent to work in a <name type="geo"><choice><orig>Kambodian</orig><reg>Cambodian</reg></choice></name> cloth factory for a day.</s>
        <s>They experienced the life of a seamstress and <name type="geo"><choice><orig>cambodia</orig><reg>Cambodia</reg></choice></name> and report that they couldn't believe how bad the working conditions are there.</s>
        <s>Usually we only hear of the suffering and can't imagine it, but to experience it is something completely different.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>They come to the conclusion that we are rich because they are poor.</s>
        <s>But you shouldn't forget that these people are worth the same as us.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Don't forget this the next time you praise the effects of globalization.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope I made you realise that not everything is as perfect as it seems.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Please do tell me what you think.</s>
