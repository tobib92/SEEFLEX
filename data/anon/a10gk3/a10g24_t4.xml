        <s>I've noticed often that you're very proud of the globalisation of the world.</s>
        <s>You're right, it is a very very good progress for you and me, but not for everyone.</s>
        <s>I've done some researches and came onto that website, which is about 3 people who went for a newspaper article to <name type="geo"><choice><orig>Kambodscha</orig><reg>Cambodia</reg></choice></name> in a <choice><orig>textic</orig><reg>textile</reg></choice> fabric to know how the people live and that not <choice><orig>everthing</orig><reg>everything</reg></choice> in the world is like we have.</s>
        <s>All the progresses with technologies made people rich.</s>
        <s>The three people <foreign xml:lang="de">(erlebten)</foreign> how bad it is.</s>
        <s>All the day they had to sit in a fabric and do the same thing all day.</s>
        <s>They lived in a very little house and had only rice to eat.</s>
        <s>They felt very <foreign xml:lang="de">(unterdr√ºckt)</foreign> and <choice><orig>kinda</orig><reg>kind of</reg></choice> depressed and felt sorry for the people.</s>
        <s>Not <choice><orig>everthing</orig><reg>everything</reg></choice> is like you have it or me.</s>
        <s>Think more about it.</s>
        <s>Just to know that it is not <choice><orig>everthing</orig><reg>everything</reg></choice> perfect, that you're aware of it.</s>
