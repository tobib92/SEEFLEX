        <s>The environment pollution is the biggest and globalest problem of this century.</s>
        <s>We all know that it has devastating effects if we will not stop it.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my opinion this is a huge problem that we have to fight with.</s>
        <s>So here I'll nominate some necessary measures to solve this problem.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>As I said I'm completely against the environment pollution and to stop it one point should be to stop the energywinning through cole, because it's a massive problem of the pollution.</s>
        <s>Furthermore it should be working for an electric motor, so that we can use them for cars, airplanes, ships and all the other vehicles.</s>
        <s>Besides we should support the exploration and production of solutions for this problem.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Finally I think this is a big problem and we all can help to solve it.</s>
        <s>Otherways it'll be impossible to live in peace for the next generation.</s>
