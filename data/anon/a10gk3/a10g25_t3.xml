        <s>I think it is necessary to do something against the environment pollution, because our planet it getting more dirty.</s>

      <p>
        <s>To do something against it, plastic bottles can be recycled.</s>
        <s>A lot of people aren't putting trash in the bin.</s>
        <s>They are throwing it in plants or ar the middle of the street.</s>
        <s>We also can start an organisation or a group, who <choice><orig>sourt</orig><reg>sort</reg></choice> the trash in the bin.</s>
        <s>Other countries can also sort the waste in different bins.</s>
        <s>So we don't have the plastic and paper in one bin.</s>
        <s>In the supermarket, you don't have to buy plastic bags.</s>
        <s>You can bring your own nets for the vegetable or fruit station.</s>
        <s>Furthermore you can use the old paperbags again, so you don't have to buy new ones.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>On the other hand plastic bottles or bags are not heavy.</s>
        <s>They are also child friendly and if you drop them, <choice><orig>the</orig><reg>they</reg></choice> don't break.</s>
        <s>In addition, plastic is not expensive too.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To sum up, I would say that <choice><orig>they</orig><reg>there</reg></choice> are many different ways to make the earth a better place.</s>
        <s>If every person does help, the earth isn't dirty anymore.</s>
