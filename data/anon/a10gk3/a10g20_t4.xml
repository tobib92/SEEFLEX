        <s>how are you?</s>
        <s>I hope well!</s>
        <s>I read an article about the losers of the globalisation and three <choice><orig>joung</orig><reg>young</reg></choice> people who worked one day as a seamstress and tell us about their impressions.</s>
        <s>I thought that this <choice><orig>maight</orig><reg>might</reg></choice> interst you because you never think about those people.</s>
        <s>I'll tell you what I read in the article.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The three people worked in a <choice><orig>textil</orig><reg>textile</reg></choice> manufacture.</s>
        <s>They talk and visit the people there.</s>
        <s>All in all they live a day like and with the people there.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All the three were <choice><orig>shoked</orig><reg>shocked</reg></choice> of the working conditions there.</s>
        <s>After some hours they were desperated, because they did the same thing the whole day.</s>
        <s>As a conclusion of their visit they say that everyone has the same value and nobody should suffer such as them who worker there.</s>
        <s>They decided to fight against the robbery of their <choice><orig>lifes</orig><reg>lives</reg></choice> for our products.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope I could give you an other point of view of this delicate theme and I hope you I let you change your view about it.</s>
