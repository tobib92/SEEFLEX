        <salute>Hello,</salute>

        <s><choice><orig>It's</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> me again.</s>
        <s>I hope you've read my last mail I wrote.</s>
        <s>Nevertheless I Saw that you need my help to keep <name type="misc">THUG</name> in the curriculums and I want to help you.</s>
        <s>The book showing vulgar speech, contains offensive language and sexual references, depicts and promotes drug abuse and showing the police in a negative light may be true to some degree but it only shows the reality, or at least tries to.</s>
        <s>It is pretty dumb to just close the eyes and pretend not to see reality in my opinion.</s>
        <s>It is a recommended book because it resembles and not just because it is a fantasy book.</s>
        <s>A lot of events can be found happening in real life and are even broadcasted to <name type="geo">Germany</name>: for example the protests for <name type="person">George Floyd</name>.</s>
        <s>I think it is more important to show and let pupils emphasize on how one may feel by experiencing abusal behaviour from the police or discrimination.</s>
        <s>This is not only important in the <name type="geo">US</name> but on the whole <choice><orig>word</orig><reg>world</reg></choice> I believe.</s>
        <s>I hope you'll make the school board reconsider and I wish you good luck.</s>
