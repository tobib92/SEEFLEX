        <s>Yesterday I did some research about racism in the <name type="geo">USA</name> and I found an article, which informations truly surprised me.</s>
        <s>I want to ask you about your experiences.</s>
        <s>How do you deal with this <add>big</add> problem?</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The article is about some statistics which are showing that African Americans are deprived socially and economically.</s>
        <s>The reason for this divide is the police, who stop-and-frisk African <choice><orig>American</orig><reg>Americans</reg></choice> way more often than white Americans and that is a reason why African Americans are getting arrested more often.</s>
        <s>The education of African Americans is way more abd than of white Americans because they don't reach a graduation as easily as we can, they have to work harder because of the <choice><orig>unequality</orig><reg>inequality</reg></choice>, which is still there since more than 50 years after the <name type="misc">Civil Rights Movement</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the <name type="geo">USA</name> more than 1/4th of the African Americans are poor while <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> not even 1/10th for white Americans.</s>
