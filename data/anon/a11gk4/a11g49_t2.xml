        <s>In the following I am going to analyze how <name type="person">Starr's</name> state of mind is presented and how point of view and other narrative techniques add to this effect.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Because this scene is written in <quote>I</quote> sentence construction and relies on the <choice><orig>first person</orig><reg>first-person</reg></choice> pronouns, I can conclude that it's written in <choice><orig>first person</orig><reg>first-person</reg></choice> point of view.</s>
        <s>The <choice><orig>first person</orig><reg>first-person</reg></choice> point of view helps the reader to have a deeper look into a character's mind and achieves intimacy.</s>
        <s>The disadvantage of the <choice><orig>first person</orig><reg>first-person</reg></choice> point of view is that the <choice><orig>readers</orig><reg>readers'</reg></choice> view is limited because of the ability of the character.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Only seeing <name type="person">Starr's</name> point of view and her opinions creates authenticity in the minds of the reader.</s>
        <s>When <name type="person">Starr</name> says the opposite of what she <choice><orig>tinks</orig><reg>thinks</reg></choice>, only the reader and her can see what is truly going on in her mind, it's the same with her emotions.</s>
        <s>When she feels something the person she is talking to has no chance to recognize her feelings, but the reader does.</s>
