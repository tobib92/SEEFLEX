        <salute>Hey Damien,</salute>

        <s><choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> hope you and your family are doing well.</s>
        <s>I found about <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> article called <ref target="a11gk4_2" type="title"> Schwarze in der USA: Der Rassismus ist messbar"</ref> from <ref target="a11gk4_2" type="author">Alexandra Endres</ref> which was published on <date>25th of August 2014</date> at <date>9:01 pm</date>, in <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> digital <choice><orig>newspaperarticle</orig><reg>newspaper article</reg></choice> called <name type="misc">Zeit Online</name>, which is about black people getting discriminated by the police and how bad they are getting treated in <choice><orig>comparisation</orig><reg>comparison</reg></choice> to white people.</s>
        <s>I wanted to let you know about that, because it really gives one a picture of how bad black people are getting treated and <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> think <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> a big problem of the <name type="geo">US</name>, that we have to talk about more.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The author says, that statistics are showing, that black people are getting more in trouble with the police than white people, and that police officers are stopping and frisking them harder than white people.</s>
        <s>Even <choice><orig>tho</orig><reg>though</reg></choice> there is something called <name type="misc">Civil Rights Act</name>, which is supposed to stop the discrimnation, but <choice><orig>thats</orig><reg>that's</reg></choice> 50 years ago, and black people are still getting treated worse.</s>
        <s>Additionally, black people have a higher chance of not getting a graduation and getting no money, and even <choice><orig>tho</orig><reg>though</reg></choice> the chance of getting no job if you have graduated is higher for black than white people.</s>
        <s>In fact, every fourth black person is porr, and not even every tenth person is poor.</s>

      <p>
        <s>I hope <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> was able to tell you some <choice><orig>intersting</orig><reg>interesting</reg></choice> informations and that you see that discrimination is still a major problem in the <name type="geo">US</name>.</s>
