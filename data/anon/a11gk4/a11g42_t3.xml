        <s>I heard, that your school board thinks about banning <name type="misc">The Hate U Give</name> from the school libraries.</s>
        <s>Because, it is too vulgar, contains offensive langauge and so on.</s>
        <s>You asked me for support and my opinion.</s>
        <s>My opinion is, that this novel shows how bad black people <choice><orig>lives</orig><reg>live</reg></choice> with racism and how<surplus> and how</surplus> a life of a 16-year-old girl can be destroyed because of racism.</s>
        <s>I think, it gives a reason, why there are some negative aspects in this book, it just <choice><orig>want</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> to show, how the people <choice><orig>lives</orig><reg>live</reg></choice> and <choice><orig>thinks</orig><reg>think</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>And the negative aspects your school board says, are just the reality, how black people have to live.</s>
        <s>I think you should <choice><orig>speek</orig><reg>speak</reg></choice> again with your school board and show them, that nothing is a reason to banning this novel out of the school <choice><orig>libararies</orig><reg>libraries</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>It is just the real life of black people!</s>
        <s>I know you get this!</s>
