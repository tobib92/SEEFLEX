        <salute>Dear John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>you asked me about whether you should ban <name type="misc">The Hate U Give</name> from the school library or not.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think that you should absolutely not ban the book <choice><orig>becaus</orig><reg>because</reg></choice> it gives insight on the life of a black person under systematic racism and everybody should know about it even if we don't understand it we should at least try to let someone explain it to us and this book is doing a great job at this.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Even if the school board wants to ban it because it is <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> vulgar you shouldn't do it because that is reality for <choice><orig>alot</orig><reg>a lot</reg></choice> of people all over the world.</s>
        <s>In my opinion you shouldn't ban it but make everyone read it because <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> many people don't know about the conditions many black people <choice><orig>life</orig><reg>live</reg></choice> in all over the world.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope I helped you make your decision.</s>
