        <s>Her choice of sentence structure and her use of language and stylistic devices play a key-role.</s>
        <s><ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> is often answered by questions, questioning what led to his decisions <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 8f.)</ref> or what could have had changed his mind <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 24f.)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This makes <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> appear weak, insecure and <choice><orig>showes</orig><reg>shows</reg></choice> a kind of dominance <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> has over <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref>.</s>
        <s>Eventhough <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> is the one leading it in a certain direction.</s>
        <s>Not only is she quesitoning <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Macbeths</orig><reg>Macbeth's</reg></choice></ref> behaviour, but she also tries to play with <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Macbeths</orig><reg>Macbeth's</reg></choice></ref> conscience of letting her down with their plan just because he is a coward <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 15f.)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In addition to that she makes use of a metaphor, comparing <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> to a cat that wants fish, but would not get her paws wet <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 18)</ref>.</s>

        <s>She uses a climax saying that he could be much more than the simple man he is <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 26ff.)</ref>.</s>
        <s>She puts in contrast that the time that wasn't is now right.</s>
        <s>But now that the time is right he again is <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> scared of acting making him seem like a coward, as she said before <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(ll. 28ff.)</ref>.</s>
