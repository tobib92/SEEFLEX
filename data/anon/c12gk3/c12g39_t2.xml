        <s>In the first part of <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 8-18)</ref>, she answers to the thoughts of <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> and he does not want to kill <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Duncan</ref>.</s>
        <s>She asks if he was drunk when he made the plan and if this is the reason he does not want to do this.</s>
        <s>With this <choice><orig>rethorical</orig><reg>rhetorical</reg></choice> questions she wants <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> to overthink his descision and to convince him of doing it.</s>
        <s>After that she uses the fact that <choice><orig>males</orig><reg>males'</reg></choice> honor is pretty important to them <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 16)</ref>.</s>
        <s>With line 18: <quote>Like the poor cat i'th'adage?</quote> she tells that sometimes it is okay to have blood on the own hands to achieve a thing you want.</s>
        <s><ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> answers <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 20-22)</ref> and it is exactly what <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> wanted to create.</s>
        <s><ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> is angry and wants to protect his honor <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 22)</ref>.</s>
        <s>She argues again <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>and</reg></choice> says that he said once that he needs perfect timing and that now there is the perfect timing <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 24-31)</ref>.</s>
        <s>After that she compares it with killing her own baby to achieve her dream.</s>
        <s>And this heavy fact underlines how important it is for <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> that her husband is going to be king <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 31-35)</ref>.</s>
        <s>And also that he made promise and that she would never break a promise.</s>
        <s>From line 40 to 53 <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> explains the plan and tells it like it is so easy so convince <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> to do it.</s>
        <s>And in the end of the scene <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> agrees and <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> succeeded.</s>

      <p>
        <s><ref target="c12gk3_1" type="author"><choice><orig>Shakespear</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice></ref> works with many <choice><orig>rethorical</orig><reg>rhetorical</reg></choice> questions <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 9, 14, 25, 51)</ref>.</s>
        <s>With this type of argumentation <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> always lets it seem to be so easy and normal.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>also</orig><reg>Also</reg></choice> she attacks his honor again and again and asks him if he is not brave enough.</s>
        <s>With this line of argumentation <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> has to <choice><orig>proof</orig><reg>prove</reg></choice> that she is wrong.</s>
        <s>The next big point is that she refers to the fact that she would kill her own baby for her dreams <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 31-36)</ref>.</s>
        <s>And after this <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> is under a lot of pressure.</s>
        <s>Also the fact that he promised to kill <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Duncan</ref> leaves him at a very bad point if he will not do it.</s>

        <s>The last strategy of <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> works in the end.</s>
        <s>It is, that she explains the whole plan and it looks like it is so easy <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 40-53)</ref>.</s>
        <s>After this <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> finally is convinced.</s>
        <s>Also it is important to say that <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="author"><choice><orig>Shakespear</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice></ref> ends the parts of <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> often with a question.</s>

        <s>Also there is one <choice><orig>Anaphora</orig><reg>anaphora</reg></choice> in this scene in line 31 to 33.</s>
        <s>Both sentences start with <quote>I</quote> and this has the effect of underlining what she would do to get what she wants.</s>

      <p>
        <s>All in all the author creates with <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> a strong <choice><orig>women</orig><reg>woman</reg></choice> that knows what she wants and who knows how to manipulate.</s>
        <s>The author also does not work with many stylistic devices.</s>
        <s>Just a few like mentioned.</s>
        <s>For example <choice><orig>rethorical</orig><reg>rhetorical</reg></choice> questions and comparisons.</s>

      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In general there needs to be said that <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> is the one who presses on <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> to kill <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Duncan</ref>.</s>
