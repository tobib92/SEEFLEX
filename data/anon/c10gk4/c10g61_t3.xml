        <salute>Dear John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I disagree with you on the topic of student exchanges.</s>
        <s>I don't think they are a waste of time, they just push you out of your comfort zone.</s>
        <s>Here all some arguments that might convince you.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Firstly, student exchanges are a key in being successful in the work place for many jobs, since you have to communicate and deal with people from all around the world.</s>
        <s>This gets easier if you have some experience in integrating into other cultures.</s>
        <s>These experiences you can gain by taking part in student exchanges into another country.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>If you have some prejudices of another culture, these exchanges can help you gain perspective and build your own opinion.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>If you go into a student exchange it might help tearing down mistrust and hostility towards this culture, since you can see how the people truly are.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>That's why I don't argue with you, on this topic and I hope I was able to convince you of my opinion.</s>
      </p>
