        <salute>Hello John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>How are you?</s>
        <s>I hope you and your family are doing good.</s>
        <s>I know that you think that student exchanges are a waste of time, but let me tell you my thoughts and arguments.</s>
        <s>So the first argument is that you get to know new people and language, for example <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>It is useful because it is the world language and you can speak it almost everywhere.</s>
        <s>It is also a good argument, that you can study in better <choice><orig>universitys</orig><reg>universities</reg></choice> or <choice><orig>universitys</orig><reg>universities</reg></choice> that don't even exist in your country.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The last argument is that you can visit cities like <name type="geo">London</name>, <name type="geo">New York</name> or <name type="geo">Paris</name> and try out new food.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my opinion a student exchange is worth it because the way you see the world will change in a positive way and also your knowledge.</s>
        <s>I hope I could change your mind.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Have a good day and let me hear about you!</s>
      </p>
