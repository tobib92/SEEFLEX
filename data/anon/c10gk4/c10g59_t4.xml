        <s>I was recently given an article by my friend <name type="person">Bianca</name> about her experience working with children in a slum in <name type="geo">Delhi</name>.</s>
        <s>She is 18 years old, from <name type="geo">Germany</name> who worked in an <name type="misc">Education Center</name> for children in <name type="geo">India</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><name type="person">Bianca</name> expresses that even though the long days with the kids may have been tiring and frustrating, she still loved every day she could spend with the kids.</s>
        <s>Patience and thankfulness are only two among other things that the children taught her.</s>
        <s>She tells us that she always wondered how the kids could be so happy and full of life despite their living condition.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Bianca</name> describes them as loving, accepting and nosy about your background and life.</s>
        <s>Therefore after spending at least two and a hald hours with the children a day, they grew on her.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all it was a great and fascinating experience for <name type="person">Bianca</name>.</s>
