        <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Thank you for you e-mail!</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To answer your question I came across an article of the <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> newspaper <name type="misc">Zeit</name> from <date>2019</date> which illustrated an isolated Germany.</s>
        <s>It mentioned the following: Germany as an industrial <choice><orig>coutry</orig><reg>country</reg></choice> needs the export market.</s>
        <s>I mean, think of our car industry, you've probably seen <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> cars in the USA.</s>
        <s>But even if you don't consider the economic aspect of the export industry in Germany, we rely on certain goods and <choice><orig>recources</orig><reg>resources</reg></choice> from other countries.</s>
        <s>The article <choice><orig>mentiones</orig><reg>mentions</reg></choice> oil for example.</s>
        <s>As you know, it is required for all sort of production, in nearly every sector.</s>
        <s>But Germany has no natural oil <choice><orig>recources</orig><reg>resources</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>We therefore would remain dependent, at least with imported goods, from other countries.</s>
        <s>Completely left aside, half of the <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> <choice><orig>industrys</orig><reg>industry's</reg></choice> jobs are dependent on the export market.</s>
        <s>Germany isolating <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> productions would <choice><orig>interfer</orig><reg>interfere</reg></choice> with those employees.</s>
        <s>One advantage mentioned in the article is, that the collected income may be distributed better than in the past, which would lower the number of socially deprived citizens.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>Allthough</orig><reg>Although</reg></choice> life would become so much more boring, don't you think?</s>
        <s>I mean, isn't it our globalized world, which makes our <choice><orig>societie</orig><reg>society</reg></choice> so diverse and interesting?</s>
        <s>Foreign food would not be imported any longer - definitely a loss for me!</s>
        <s>Something the article also <choice><orig>mentiones</orig><reg>mentions</reg></choice> is that globalization connects us, doesn't it?</s>
        <s>It has so many advantages in our daily life and even if there are disadvantages like we see with <name type="misc">Covid-19</name>, the advantages of an open world overweigh for me!</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>See you soon!</s>
