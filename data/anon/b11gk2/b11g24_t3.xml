        <s>I have just read <name type="misc">Disgraced</name> in school and I would agree with <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> that it is an issue if faith is your main identity marker.</s>
        <s>You can't <choice><orig>devide</orig><reg>divide</reg></choice> people only in nationalities, religions or ethnicities.</s>
        <s>It's wrong to say that people's appearance automatically they are from this religion or this nationality.</s>
        <s>Of course the appearance gives you a first impression about a human.</s>
        <s>Another point is that people might feel forced to hide her or his religion because they feel uncomfortable in the society.</s>
