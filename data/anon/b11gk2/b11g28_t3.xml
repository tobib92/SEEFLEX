        <salute>Dear Sir or Madam,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I am writing to you in response to the interview with <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> which has only recently been published in <name type="misc">Guernica Magazine</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I am a <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> student from <name type="geo"><choice><orig>cologne</orig><reg>Cologne</reg></choice></name>, so I may have a different perspective.</s>
        <s>We just read <name type="misc">Disgraced</name> in our <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> class and then I came across your article.</s>
        <s>The identity and faith are big topics in <name type="misc">Disgraced</name> and <name type="misc">Amir</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Personally, I think that faith and identity do not belong together.</s>
        <s>Or that one thing is characteristic for the other one.</s>
        <s><name type="misc">Amir</name> grew up in an environment, where the faith had a huge influence in everything, for example in love.</s>
        <s>I am sure <name type="misc">Amir</name> sees it the same way as <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name>, because they both changed their name.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In their opinion it sounded <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> and it made their life harder.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It is important to remember that I <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> see this thing as <name type="misc">Amir</name> or any <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> or person who used to be a <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice>, because right after <name type="misc">9/11</name> it was really hard for them in every situation, even walking on the street must have been torture, because of the looks and the thoughts you know they have.</s>
        <s>The suspicions were everywhere and in this case I am sure I would have thought that the faith is <choice><orig>one</orig><reg>one's</reg></choice> <choice><orig>main's</orig><reg>main</reg></choice> identity marker, but these were different circumstances.</s>
        <s>In <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir's</ref> case he tried everything to not be seen anymore as a <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice>, and also <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> thinks it is an identity marker <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 34, l. 13-15)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To sum it up, in my opinion it is hard to give one clear answer to the question because it depends on how much you are connected to the faith, how much your family is connected and what circumstances are.</s>
        <s>Some <choice><orig>persones</orig><reg>persons</reg></choice> <choice><orig>defines</orig><reg>define</reg></choice> <choice><orig>themselfes</orig><reg>themselves</reg></choice> with their faith and some people hide it or do not talk about it.</s>
