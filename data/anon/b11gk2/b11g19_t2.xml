        <s>In the following text I am going to <choice><orig>analize</orig><reg>analyze</reg></choice> the excerpt of scene three with the turning point and I will show that this outburst of emotions from <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> was just a time question.</s>

      <p>
        <s>After a long evening with the <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>two</reg></choice> pairs and a conflict about the religion of <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref>, <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref> and him are dryning about their job in their lawyer firm while <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> are kissing in the kitchen.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The first turning point is not on the side of the emotions but quiet before, because <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> finds out <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref> will get the position that he thinks he deserves.</s>
        <s>That is on one hand understandable because he works longer for their chambers <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 74, l. 3)</ref> but on the other hand <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref> and the bosses are saying <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> is duplicitous <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 73, l. 7)</ref> which is understandable too with context <choice><orig>arround</orig><reg>around</reg></choice> this excerpt.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The second and much more important turning point happens between all of the four characters but most on <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Amirs</orig><reg>Amir's</reg></choice></ref> side.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>After <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> insult him indirect <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 72, l. 30f.)</ref> <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> are close to fight again each other <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 72, l. 39)</ref>.</s>
        <s>That especially <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> doesn't like <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> very much could be seen in scene two <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 44, l. 33)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The turning point between <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref> and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> comes within the interruption of <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref>.</s>
        <s>As <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> honest person <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 51, l. 29)</ref> she is shocked and screams that she doesn't want to get touched from <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 72, l. 32/38)</ref> which makes him really angry <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 72, l. 39)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The marriage between those two is broke which is clear after <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> went out first <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 73, l. 2)</ref>, whether he did the wrong thing.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The third and most unexpectable turning point is between <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Since scene one they had a few conflicts mostly about the Islam.</s>
        <s>But the conflicts got bigger and bigger.</s>
        <s>The first one in scene one was about the <name type="misc">Vel√°zquez</name> painting.</s>
        <s>In the same scene the first discussion about <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir's</ref> religion came up and the first sights of him on his own conflict with the religion was shown.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> told his story about his first crush and the schocking things that had <choice><orig>happend</orig><reg>happened</reg></choice> with his mother <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 39)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Back then <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> had his first emotional outburst.</s>
        <s>Since this moment he has a negative view on the Islam which can be shown by the discussions with <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Abe</ref> or <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> or even at the dinner.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The second conflict with <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> was after the newspaper article and the third one indirect because <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> <choice><orig>invits</orig><reg>invites</reg></choice> <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref>.</s>
        <s>The fourth one was quiet before <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Jory</ref> and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> entered their room.</s>
        <s>Everytime they argued it was not that one of them left the room or shouted.</s>
        <s>That <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> did not talk with <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> the end and risked a big argument is one of the reasons this outburst of emotions is not unexpectable.</s>
        <s>A huge sign was also that <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> threw his <choice><orig>glas</orig><reg>glass</reg></choice>, because instead of talking he just started to drink and when he gets drunk his actions get more physically which is the second sign for his following actions.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The moment when he finds out that <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> slept <choice><orig>ones</orig><reg>once</reg></choice> with <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref> is <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> much for his head.</s>
