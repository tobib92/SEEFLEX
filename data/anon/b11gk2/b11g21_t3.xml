        <salute>Dear Sir or Madam</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I am writing to you in response to the <choice><orig>Interview</orig><reg>interview</reg></choice> with <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> which has only recently been published in <name type="misc">Guernica Magazine</name>.</s>
        <s>We just read <name type="misc">Disgraced</name> in school, so I would like to comment on a quote.</s>
        <s><name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> claims that the faith is <choice><orig>ones</orig><reg>one's</reg></choice> main identity marker.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>First I want to talk about <name type="misc"><choice><orig>Amirs</orig><reg>Amir's</reg></choice></name> point of view on it.</s>
        <s>Since <name type="misc">Amir</name> wants to retire from being <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> I don't think he would agree.</s>
        <s>Besides of it his wife <name type="misc">Emily</name> and his friends <name type="misc">Jory</name> and <name type="misc">Isaac</name> aren't <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> but he still was very close to them.</s>
        <s>We can only see one <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> who had much contact to <name type="misc">Amir</name> and that was his nephew <name type="misc">Abe</name>.</s>
        <s><name type="misc">Amir</name> has more contact to <choice><orig>american</orig><reg>American</reg></choice> people then to <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> people what can be seen in scene one, when <name type="misc">Amir</name> doesn't want to help the <choice><orig>muslim</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> imam.</s>
        <s>To sum it up <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> am really sure, that <name type="misc">Amir</name> wouldn't agree with <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> in this point.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I as a <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> student would neither agree with Mr. <name type="misc">Akhtar</name>.</s>
        <s>I see some problems for me in this opinion.</s>
        <s>First as an unreligious person <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> can't put myself in his position.</s>
        <s>But <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> can understand if someone was religiously educated that religion can be your main identity marker.</s>
        <s>But in <name type="geo">Germany</name> it isn't like this.</s>
        <s>The religion of people is often not relevant and everyone has friends from other religions and cultures.</s>
        <s>A lot of people change or give up their religion.</s>
        <s>And I have no problem with someone having this or that religion.</s>
        <s>For someone's character is much more important than someone's religion or faith and <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> think a lot of people in <name type="geo">Germany</name> think so.</s>
        <s>But <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> still like seeing other cultures and point of views like <name type="misc">Ayad Akhtar</name> ones.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope you can understand my opinion.</s>
        <s>And of course thank you for this inspiring interview.</s>

      <p>Best <choice><orig>Regards</orig><reg>regards</reg></choice></p>
