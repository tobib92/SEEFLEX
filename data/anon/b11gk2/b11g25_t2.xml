      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The following <q>beat</q> is also very a meaningful beat.</s>
        <s>It shows the silence after something pretty bad that just <choice><orig>happend</orig><reg>happened</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>It feels like this is a pretty loud scene and pause between the actions.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It follows another racist and by <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref>.</s>

        <s><ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> does not respond to that.</s>
        <s>Maybe because he does not know what he <choice><orig>have</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> said everything he wanted to already.</s>
        <s>There were no other reactions to <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Amirs</orig><reg>Amir's</reg></choice></ref> spit which leads me to think, that they all were massively <choice><orig>shoked</orig><reg>shocked</reg></choice>.</s>

      <p>
        <s>To spit in <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Isaacs</orig><reg>Isaac's</reg></choice></ref> face must have meant more to <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> because of his childhood, where his mother spat in <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Amirs</orig><reg>Amir's</reg></choice></ref> face because of staying in contact with a <choice><orig>jewish</orig><reg>Jewish</reg></choice> girl.</s>

      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Another <choice><orig>interest</orig><reg>interesting</reg></choice> aspect is, that it seemed before like <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> does not really care about the thing between <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Isaac</ref>, because he just mentioned it just once <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 18-19, p. 72)</ref>.</s>

        <s>But when they are alone again, <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> starts to ask her, if she sleeps with him <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(l. 27)</ref>.</s>
        <s>That shows, that he had it all the time in mind and that he does care about it.</s>

      <p>

        <s>Her following sentences leads to think, that she is not unsure about that, but more about the way she tells <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> that she had an affair and cheated on him.</s>

        <s>That shows <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Emilys</orig><reg>Emily's</reg></choice></ref> kind of ashameness and maybe afraidness against the <choice><orig>uncontroled</orig><reg>uncontrolled</reg></choice> man in front of her.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The fact that she tells <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> could be seen as an act of <choice><orig>honisty</orig><reg>honesty</reg></choice>, or as a way and a reason out of the relationship.</s>

      <p>
        <s><ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Amirs</orig><reg>Amir's</reg></choice></ref> reaction is the turning point of the whole play.</s>
        <s>He starts hitting <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> in her face, till he recognizes what he did.</s>
        <s>The way of his recognization shows the act of uncontrolleness.</s>
        <s>His words <quote>Oh, my God...</quote> describes his kind of shockness and afraidness of himself.</s>

      <p>
        <s>After he busted all out of his anger by hitting his wife, it is a completely twist of the way you look and <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> and the book.</s>
        <s>A few pages before <add>(already in scene three)</add>, <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> talked about the Quran and that you were allowed to hit your wife to show that the <quote>Men are in charge of women...</quote> <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(p. 64, ll. 12-17)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The following income of the nephew <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Abe</ref> and his silence looks at <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Emily</ref> and then at <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 20-24)</ref> <choice><orig>symolises</orig><reg>symbolizes</reg></choice> the hardness of the act that they are not even ready to speak about it.</s>

        <s>All in all I have to recognize my thesis of the scene three as a turning point and the final outburst of <ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> as correct.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><ref target="b11gk2_1" type="character">Amir</ref> always showed his emotions but in a verbal way.</s>
