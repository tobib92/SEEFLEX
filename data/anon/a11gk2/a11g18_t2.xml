        <s>In the following it will be analysed how <ref target="a11gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> tries to convince the audience that <quote>dreams are worth fighting for</quote>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><ref target="a11gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> starts off by referring to the occasion and telling the audience that he feels home to show his sympathy.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>He uses a correctio <ref target="a11gk2_1" type="line">(l. 2f)</ref> <quote>But the truth is...</quote> and <choice><orig>poins</orig><reg>points</reg></choice> out that everyone shares more with each other <choice><orig>then</orig><reg>than</reg></choice> just the place they live.</s>
        <s>This creates a feeling of unity.</s>

        <s>This makes the audience feel worthy also as individuals.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Moreover the repetition <ref target="a11gk2_1" type="line">(l. 14)</ref> <quote>... gave him a chance ... gave them a chance</quote> makes clear that these dreams and values are reasons to hold on because <choice><orig>thats</orig><reg>that's</reg></choice> what his <choice><orig>Grandparents</orig><reg>grandparents</reg></choice> did.</s>

      <p>
        <s>The emotive language also creates a connection between <ref target="a11gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> and the audience.</s>
