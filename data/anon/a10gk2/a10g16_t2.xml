        <s>To do this, the <choice><orig>autor</orig><reg>author</reg></choice> used many stylistic devices, which <choice><orig>Im</orig><reg>I'm</reg></choice> going to analyse in the following.</s>

        <s>He also makes use of enumerations like in line 7-8 <quote>good working conditions, good wages and save working environment</quote> to present the reader how little the unions are needed.</s>
