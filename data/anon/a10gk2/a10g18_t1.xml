        <s>In the article <ref target="a10gk2_1" type="title">Is the usefulness of unions in the protection of workers rights coming to an end? The answer is yes</ref>, published in <name type="misc">The Gulf News</name> on <date>24 November 2011</date>, the author <ref target="a10gk2_1" type="author">Brian Pollard</ref> expresses his opinion on the current state of unions and their unexpected downsides.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>He starts with explaining how unions helped in the first place and that they have greatly improved the life of many <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> workers around the world.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Mr. <ref target="a10gk2_1" type="author">Pollard</ref> then goes on to writing about how his opinion changed and that unions are no longer required to ensure the workers' good working conditions because the <choice><orig>lagislation</orig><reg>legislation</reg></choice> and laws have taken that task.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Afterwards the author goes more into explaining, that companies that work under unions have no choice with their expensive products to compete against companies who sell <choice><orig>ther</orig><reg>their</reg></choice> products for less money.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Later he tells the readers that the roles have changed and workers are now exploiting employers because they are protected and <choice><orig>dont</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> have to work at their best performance.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the end he is <choice><orig>sayin</orig><reg>saying</reg></choice> directly to the government, that they have to look ar unions as a main problem to our economics.</s>
