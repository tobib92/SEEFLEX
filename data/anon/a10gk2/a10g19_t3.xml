        <s>Working conditions in a globalised world are a very important thing, because of that I will now comment on the <choice><orig>statment</orig><reg>statement</reg></choice> of <ref target="a10gk2_1" type="author">Brian Pollard</ref>, that <quote>[...] in the twenty-first century the situation has changed workers are not being exploited by employers, now employers are being exploited by employees</quote>.</s>

        <s>I think that in rich <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> like the <name type="geo">USA</name> that might sometimes be the case, but I think that there are more than enough people who are exploited by their employers, an example of this would be <name type="geo"><choice><orig>bangladesh</orig><reg>Bangladesh</reg></choice></name> where many workers get nearly no pay and are working in inhuman conditions.</s>
        <s>Even in rich countries there are many people who don't get enough money to live <choice><orig>normaly</orig><reg>normally</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>Also it seems like the exploiting of employees will ever fully disappear.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my opinion the statement of <ref target="a10gk2_1" type="author">Brian Pollard</ref> is wrong because there are still so many workers getting exploited while the employers make a lot of money.</s>
