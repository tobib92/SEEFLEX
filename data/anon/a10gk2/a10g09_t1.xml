        <s>The article <ref target="a10gk2_1" type="title">Is the usefulness of unions in the protection of workers rights coming to an end? The answer is yes</ref> by <ref target="a10gk2_1" type="author">Brian Pollard</ref> published on <date>24th November 2011</date> in <name type="misc">The Gulf News</name> is about the evolution of unions and how they have become just as bad as what they fought against.</s>

        <s>Unions used to be about the protection of the workers rights by ensuring them better working conditions, shorter working days and higher wages.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>But over time they have become very greedy resulting in rocketing prices which can't compete with other goods.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Also the first intention of bettering workers rights is now driven by the law and our moral values.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>This problem correlates to the lack of motivation of the workers due to their job being protected by the union.</s>
        <s>Because of the power of unions the employers are also often exploited by them which is a very bad habit.</s>
        <s>Overall they are a major problem that needs to be care of.</s>
