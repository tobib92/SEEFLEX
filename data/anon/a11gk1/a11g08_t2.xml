        <s>By switching the point of view the reader gets the feeling that <name type="person">Starr</name> is not sure if she wants to be there and if she really wants to speak up for <name type="person">Khalil</name>.</s>
        <s>This gets even more clear when the point of view in the second part keeps being the <choice><orig>first person</orig><reg>first-person</reg></choice> point of view of the protagonist because it lets <name type="person">Starr</name> appear appear more confident and focused on herself instead of all the other things that happen around her.</s>
