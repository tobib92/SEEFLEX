        <salute>Dear Mr. Rump,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>to begin with the short information, my name is and I'm a 16 year old student from <name type="geo">Germany</name>, just to let you know who is writing to you.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I'm writing regarding to the banning from the novel <ref target="a11gk1_1" type="title">THUG</ref> from your school libraries.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>My good friend <name type="person">Tom</name> told me about your decision.</s>
        <s>I wanna explain you, why I think that this is a book that should available to students worldwide, also to your students.</s>
        <s>The reason, that the book has a bad influence on your students because of depicting drug use, showing the police in a negative light or is containing offensive language, I do not really understand.</s>
        <s>I think we should <choice><orig>focuse</orig><reg>focus</reg></choice> on the positive <choice><orig>thinks</orig><reg>things</reg></choice> the books is giving to us.</s>
        <s>We students can learn so many <choice><orig>thinks</orig><reg>things</reg></choice> about an important and current topic, racism, and on top, we can easily identify with the protagonist.</s>
        <s>Furthermore, the book is very <choice><orig>inspiaring</orig><reg>inspiring</reg></choice> to us, because we see a girl who became more and more herself and gives herself and her bestfriend a voice.</s>
        <s>Of course you can <choice><orig>critizes</orig><reg>criticize</reg></choice> some things, but this is the life.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Please think carefully about my words.</s>
        <s>It would be nice to hear from you.</s>
