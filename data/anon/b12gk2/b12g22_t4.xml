        <salute>Hi Evan,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><choice><orig>last</orig><reg>Last</reg></choice> week we had a <choice><orig>realy</orig><reg>really</reg></choice> nice project at our school.</s>
        <s>It was even in the newspaper!</s>
        <s>The project was along a <choice><orig>hole</orig><reg>whole</reg></choice> day.</s>
        <s>Schoolchildren, teachers and even parents could choose <choice><orig>severall</orig><reg>several</reg></choice> activities out of more than 40 workshops, all around the topic climate protection.</s>
        <s>Our school called it <name type="misc">School B goes green</name>.</s>
        <s>As different the workshops were, as different were the locations too.</s>
        <s>We could do them in our classrooms, on the school yard and some workshops were outside of the school in the city.</s>
        <s>It was so interesting that everyone was there <choice><orig>althoug</orig><reg>although</reg></choice> it was a free day.</s>
        <s>I will show you some examples for workshops we could <choice><orig>did</orig><reg>do</reg></choice>: <choice><orig>We</orig><reg>we</reg></choice> could make a <choice><orig>second-hand-markt</orig><reg>second-hand market</reg></choice> where you could buy already used clothes for cheaper than in stores or we could learn from a <foreign xml:lang="de">Kabarettist</foreign> how to speak and move in a discussion to argument better for things like the climate protection.</s>
        <s>We also learned that it's better to take a shower, than take a bath, because you can save water with it.</s>
        <s>Two girls had a kiosk <choice><orig>were</orig><reg>where</reg></choice> we could <choice><orig>bought</orig><reg>buy</reg></choice> <choice><orig>fairtrade-coffee</orig><reg>fairtrade coffee</reg></choice> or vegan and vegetarian cake.</s>
        <s>Especially the cake tasted very good.</s>
        <s>I would say it was all in all a great experience to do something for the climate protection and I hope will do it again.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Hope to see you soon.</s>
