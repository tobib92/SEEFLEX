        <salute>Hi John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I started to collect information from foreign news about the discrimination of African Americans in the <name type="geo">USA</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The most helpful article was published in the German newspaper called <name type="misc">Zeit Online</name> and was written by <name type="person">Alexandra <choice><orig>Enders</orig><reg>Endres</reg></choice></name>.</s>
        <s>This newspaper is very neutral and has no political views.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the first week of <date>August 2014</date> an African American man was gunned down by a police officer.</s>
        <s>The discrimination shows itself in several studies, that black people have a higher chance of being arrested than white people.</s>
        <s>Black people have often times no good education, what leads to leaving school already after High School or college instead of going to universities.</s>
        <s>And even if African American people are graduated they're often poor or don't get a job.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I really hope that I could help you with doing research in foreign news and if you'll find out more about discrimination by yourself, I recommend you to read the novel <name type="misc">The Hate U Give</name> by <ref target="a11gk3_1" type="author">Angie Thomas</ref>.</s>
