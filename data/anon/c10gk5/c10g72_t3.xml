        <s>Personally this statement is very interesting.</s>
        <s>It thematizes the question which power language holds upon us.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my opinion this statement describes how the specific languages you have <choice><orig>learnt</orig><reg>learned</reg></choice>, and the amount determines your possibilities in every aspect of the world.</s>
        <s>For example not learning <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> impedes you on digital international communication in public social-networks as it is primary used there.</s>
        <s>Sticking to your native-language restricts you to only travelling to <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> where this language is spoken.</s>
        <s>Additionally some work-places <choice><orig>requires</orig><reg>require</reg></choice> their employees to be multilingual thus making language able to narrow your possibilities in work.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Last but not least it is a neurological fact, that the process of learning a language strengthens your brain.</s>
        <s>Through this, you can get <choice><orig>divers</orig><reg>diverse</reg></choice> advantages for example increased intelligence.</s>
        <s>On the other hand, restricting yourself to your native-language withholds you from these advantages and can result in you staying unintellectual.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>This range of <choice><orig>disadvantag</orig><reg>disadvantages</reg></choice> of not learning a new language shows the large power language has in our lives.</s>
        <s>So I definitely agree with this.</s>
