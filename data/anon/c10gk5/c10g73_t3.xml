        <s>I can understand, what <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name> wants to say <choice><orig>whit</orig><reg>with</reg></choice> this statement and agree with his opinion, because of the following reasons.</s>
        <s>First, it is good to speak more than his own mother <choice><orig>tange</orig><reg>tongue</reg></choice> in a globalized world, because if you speak, one or two are more foreign language, your horizons is wider than others.</s>
        <s>So for example you do not have problems when you go on holiday or <choice><orig>wants</orig><reg>want</reg></choice> to study abroad.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Second, to learn a foreign language is good for your brown and make it easier to learn another language.</s>
        <s>For example, if you are from French and learn English, it is easier for you to learn after English Spanish.</s>

      <p>
        <s>To sum up language learning helps you in your allday and for example in your holidays.</s>
        <s>It keeps your brain activated and make it easier to learn another foreign language and I agree with the statement.</s>
