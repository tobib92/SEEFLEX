        <s>Once <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name>, a philosopher, said that the limits of his language are the limits of his world.</s>
        <s>With that he means that if he only <choice><orig>speek</orig><reg>speaks</reg></choice> or <choice><orig>understand</orig><reg>understands</reg></choice> one language, also his horizon maybe in his future job-life is smaller.</s>
        <s>Because then he <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> for example study on abroad <choice><orig>universitys</orig><reg>universities</reg></choice> or <choice><orig>communicat</orig><reg>communicate</reg></choice> with people from other <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>But on the other side, with many languages there are much benefits and aspects that are good for your future.</s>
        <s>Like working abroad or maybe having a relationship there.</s>
        <s>I think, the benefits and disadvantages work together with your wishes for your future <choice><orig>live</orig><reg>life</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>If you do not want to work or study abroad, learning a foreign language is too much work when you would concentrate on your future wishes.</s>
        <s>But if you like travelling and communicating with different people and working with them, an other language makes this easier.</s>

      <p>
        <s>In conclusion I can say that you have to know what you want to do and <choice><orig>weight</orig><reg>weigh</reg></choice> the arguments.</s>
        <s>Personally I do not need another language for my future, so I do not like to learn more languages than German and English.</s>
