        <s>In this comment I'm going to say my opinion to the quote of <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name>.</s>
        <s>The quote is <quote>the limits of my language are the limits of my world</quote>.</s>
        <s>I think I can agree to his quote because I think it is true what he said, when you go in a new country where you have to learn a new language.</s>
        <s>You can only be a part of the society there when you can speak the language.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Imagine you going from <name type="geo">Germany</name> to the <name type="geo">USA</name> you have to learn <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> or you have to improve it.</s>
        <s>You can only to the things that are that huge then your words horizont.</s>
        <s>When you don't learn a language then you are going to live in a parallel society, and you can't discover the diversity of the whole world.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So all in all I can agree to <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name>.</s>
