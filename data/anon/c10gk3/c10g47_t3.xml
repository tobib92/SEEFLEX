        <s>There are <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> influences in a multicultural society.</s>

      <p>
        <s>On the one side hand it is positive because there are many <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> cultures <choice><orig>comming</orig><reg>coming</reg></choice> together they can learn a lot from each other.</s>
        <s>Many people become so <choice><orig>mutch</orig><reg>much</reg></choice> more tolerant for people from <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> countries and other cultures.</s>
        <s>But on the other side there are also some negative points.</s>
        <s>For example there are still many intolerant people who <choice><orig>dont</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> accept people from <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> countries or <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> cultures.</s>
        <s>Especially because of the history where for example black people <choice><orig>werent</orig><reg>weren't</reg></choice> <choice><orig>acceptet</orig><reg>accepted</reg></choice> and where slavery was a big thing.</s>
        <s>Also a problem for many people is that they want to keep their traditions and they want to have their country just like how it was and they <choice><orig>dont</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> <choice><orig>eccept</orig><reg>accept</reg></choice> immigrants with other cultures in their country.</s>
        <s>So there is still a lot racism in many countries.</s>
