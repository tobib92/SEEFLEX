        <s>The multicultural aspects of <choice><orig>socitys</orig><reg>societies</reg></choice> like the British or American one are great for both the immigrants and the original population <choice><orig>beacause</orig><reg>because</reg></choice> the immigrants bring so much new culture into the daily lives of the population as they take important aspects of their <choice><orig>socity</orig><reg>society</reg></choice> back home with them to their immigration destination like their food, clothing, songs, holidays and language so that after a time these aspects become a part of <choice><orig>everyones</orig><reg>everyone's</reg></choice> lives and it enriches <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> like the <name type="geo">USA</name> greatly.</s>
        <s>But this multicultural <choice><orig>socity</orig><reg>society</reg></choice> also has its downfalls, when you see that racist white cops kill black people for the most inconceivable reasons today or when important black activists like <name type="person">Martin Luther King Jr.</name> just get shot and killed because they are black.</s>
        <s>This racism that is <choice><orig>commen</orig><reg>common</reg></choice> in every single multicultural <choice><orig>socity</orig><reg>society</reg></choice> has its roots in fear, fear of the unknown and lots of ignorance and this is in my opinion the biggest downfall of a multicultural <choice><orig>socity</orig><reg>society</reg></choice> like the British or American one and the sad part is that you <choice><orig>cant</orig><reg>can't</reg></choice> really stop <choice><orig>rasicm</orig><reg>racism</reg></choice> <choice><orig>atleast</orig><reg>at least</reg></choice> not <choice><orig>completly</orig><reg>completely</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>Because racist <choice><orig>indviduals</orig><reg>individuals</reg></choice> will always form a little sub <choice><orig>socity</orig><reg>society</reg></choice> of their own empowering their racist ideals and <choice><orig>recruting</orig><reg>recruiting</reg></choice> new members.</s>
        <s>So in conclusion finding a balance between your own culture and that of the immigration destination can be difficult, I should know as I was once in this position but <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> <choice><orig>difinalty</orig><reg>definitely</reg></choice> possible to find a stable <choice><orig>balence</orig><reg>balance</reg></choice> and thrive.</s>
