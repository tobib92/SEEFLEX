        <s>my name is <name type="person">Faraj al-Byarshan</name>.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>Im</orig><reg>I'm</reg></choice> 41 years old and I immigrated to <name type="geo">New York</name> from <name type="geo">Iraq</name> in <date>2005</date>.</s>
        <s>I immigrated because in <name type="geo">Iraq</name> there is an awful situation and <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> can't secure that everyone in my family is safe.</s>
        <s>I also want that my two sons can get some education.</s>
        <s>I want them to feel <choice><orig>save</orig><reg>safe</reg></choice> when they grow up.</s>
        <s>They can't <choice><orig>loose</orig><reg>lose</reg></choice> the most beautiful years of their lives.</s>
        <s>They need to find friends and be happy not scared.</s>
        <s>I also want my wife to be safe aswell.</s>
        <s>That's why I went first in <date>2005</date> to see if the way to the <name type="geo">US</name> is even safe for my wife and my two sons.</s>
        <s>2 years later my wife followed with our kids.</s>
        <s>I was scared that something would happen to them in these 2 years.</s>
        <s>But when they arrived I felt relieved because we all together accomplished our dream.</s>
        <s>We could finally live in peace.</s>
        <s>A few weeks after we arrived I found a job and my kids went to school.</s>
        <s>Almost everything in the <name type="geo">US</name> was way easier than in <name type="geo">Iraq</name>.</s>
        <s>In the future I hope that many other people from critical countries can make their way to the <name type="geo">US</name> and live in peace.</s>
