        <s><ref target="a12gk3_1" type="author">Worne</ref> uses predominantly formal language, with the exception of a few words, like <quote>Cobblers</quote> <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 15)</ref> for example.</s>
        <s>They also make frequent use of inclusive language to address the reader directly, especially when appealing for change with the parents of the <name type="geo">UK</name> which they are part of <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">(cf. l. 32 <quote>and I'm one</quote>)</ref>.</s>
      </p>

        <s>By using a number of studies and figures like the <quote>latest national school exam results</quote> <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 7)</ref> or a <quote><name type="misc">recent CBI/Pearson Education and Skills Survey</name></quote> <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 19)</ref>, <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="author">Worne</ref> lends more credibility to his argument that there is decreasing amount of language-learning students.</s>

      <p>
        <s>the text shows a frequent prevalence of hyphens, for example in <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">l. 26</ref> (<quote> Number of students are opting to do so - more should</quote>) or in <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">l. 4</ref> (<quote>[...] at university level has been in steady decline - and sadly [...]</quote>).</s>
        <s>By that, the author grants the readers attention and puts emphasizing on the point they are making.</s>

        <s>By enumerating the aunt <quote> languages are essential for our trade, prosperity, cultural exports, diplomacy and national security</quote> <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 17)</ref> they also stress the importance of their appeal to increase the number of <name type="geo">UK</name> students choosing to study for and languages again.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><ref target="a12gk3_1" type="author">Worne</ref> dedicates a whole paragraph to state opposing argument representing them in an ironic way <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">(cf. l. 12-15)</ref>.</s>
        <s>They also contradict the opposing argument immediately after stating them.</s>
        <s>For example, by saying that <quote>everyone speaks English in the world of business</quote> <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">(l. 12f.)</ref> and then again saying that they are not right afterwards <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="line">(cf. l. 13)</ref>, the reader gets the impression that the opposing argument or nonsense or at least not very striking.</s>
