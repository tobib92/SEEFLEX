        <s>I would agree with <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="author">Worne's</ref> claim that language learning is vital for the <name type="geo">UK's</name> future prosperity and global standing.</s>

        <s>I think English as only language which one can speak isn't enough especially, because nobody knows how long English will be that dominant as global language as they use nowadays.</s>
        <s>Another point is that, as <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="author">Worne</ref> also mentioned in his article, employers who have language skills added to their specialist skills are more in demand as employers who only have specialist skills.</s>
        <s>This combination gives someone better chances to get a job and it's also a big advantage for someone in the competition of a place of work.</s>

        <s>The point that everyone speaks ENglish in the world is not that good in my opinion.</s>
        <s>Just because nearly everyone in the world speaks English that <choice><orig>don't</orig><reg>doesn't</reg></choice> mean that the native English speaker can communicate with everyone.</s>
        <s>Of course it's <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> advantage but it would be better if they also could speak another languages.</s>
