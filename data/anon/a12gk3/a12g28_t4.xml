        <salute>Dear John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>thank you for your nice mail.</s>
        <s>I'm doing well and I hope so do you.</s>
        <s>You told me about your plans about spending a year in Germany, especially in Berlin, so I did some research for you.</s>
        <s>I came up with the article <ref target="a12gk3_2" type="title">Berlin spricht Englisch</ref> (<quote>Berlin speaks English</quote> how you probably could decipher) by <ref target="a12gk3_2" type="author">Marina Kormbaki</ref> from <date>15 July 2016</date> that was published in the daily newspaper of <name type="geo">Hanover</name>.</s>
        <s><ref target="a12gk3_2" type="author">Kormbaki</ref> compares the capital of Germany to London, Brooklyn and Sydney because every year, loads of <choice><orig>english-speaking</orig><reg>English-speaking</reg></choice> people would go to Berlin.</s>
        <s>If you speak English and walk through the city, you should have no problem, even if you don't speak any German.</s>
        <s>It's common that <choice><orig>waitors</orig><reg>waiters</reg></choice> speak even to Germany people in English becuase they aren't sure whether they're locals or tourists.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The difference to London, Brooklyn and Sydnex are the prizes, from latte macchiato in a caf√© up to the rent of an <choice><orig>apartment</orig><reg>appartment</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>The style and design of many shops are trendy, there is a good night life and culture.</s>
        <s>For many reasons, Berlin is experiencing a huge hype.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope, I could help you with your decision and I'd love to visit you in Berlin and drink something in a bar with a designer look with you.</s>
