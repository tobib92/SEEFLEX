        <s>I'm glad your well.</s>
        <s>It's nice learning that you are thinking about visiting Germany after school.</s>
        <s>I've never been to Berlin myself, but I found this article <ref target="a12gk3_2" type="title">Berlin spricht Englisch</ref> by <ref target="a12gk3_2" type="author">Marina Kormbaki</ref> in the <name type="misc">Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung</name> which is a <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> newspaper.</s>
        <s>Maybe it can help you to make your decision whether Berlin is the place for you.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The article says that there is lots of English spoken in Berlin as well as written on signs or restaurant menus, so it would be easy for you to communicate, even on your own.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>There are many native English speaking people, mostly tourists or students, but there are also some who decided to stay there.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>According to the article, Berlin is strongly influenced by the internationlity which is why it seems similar to other big cities like London, Brooklyn or Sydney.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Another reason to visit might be the comparably low living expenses.</s>
        <s>Especially the rent is cheaper than in other cities, but also the food.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope this information was helpful to you and I'll be hearing from you soon.</s>
