        <s><name type="misc">The Telegraph</name> published a newspaper article by <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> about language learning in the UK.</s>
        <s>I read it and dealt with globalization and want to share my point of view regarding his claim that <quote> language learning is vital for the UK's future prosperity and global standing</quote>.</s>

      <p>
        <s>To my mind <ref target="a12gk3_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> is only partly right.</s>
        <s>He states, that foreign languages are necessary for trading, prosperity, cultural exports, diplomacy and national security.</s>
        <s>Considering the work I have done I don't think it is essential, as English is the world language and every country that cares about their global standing is speaking English.</s>
        <s>Nevertheless I share his opinion regarding the job advantage, as you can get a job easier in different countries.</s>
        <s>I would say that this approach is also the right, in regard to the first claim.</s>
        <s>It isn't necessary but it <choice><orig>surley</orig><reg>surely</reg></choice> helps as you have better connections to other countries.</s>
