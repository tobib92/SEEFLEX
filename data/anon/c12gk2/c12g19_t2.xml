        <s>In the following I will analyze the relationship between <name type="person">Macbeth</name> and his wife and how she convinces him of murdering <name type="person">King Duncan</name> by focussing on dialogue and language.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>From the first line on <name type="person">Lady Macbeth</name> makes clear that she is very invested into their plan by asking <name type="person">Macbeth</name> questions and doubting his intentions <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 1-3)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Her wrong and uncommon sentence construction emphasize that <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 1-3)</ref>.</s>
        <s>When <name type="person">Macbeth</name> confirms her worries by refusing to commit the murder through a metaphor for his good reputation <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 5ff)</ref>, she starts to question his manhood.</s>
        <s>With rhetorical devices and imagery about the courage he lost and his self-doubt <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 9-12)</ref> she puts pressure on him.</s>
        <s>She compares their love to his cowardice and further degrades him by comparing him to a cat <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 19)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><name type="person">Macbeth</name> defends himself by saying that he does everything a man is obligated to do <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 21)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Again <name type="person">Lady Macbeth</name> questions his masculinity and even goes so far as to state that she is more of a man than he is.</s>
        <s>She does that through the imagery of the breastfeeding baby she would be willing to kill <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 30-35)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This is also a reference to the scene where <name type="person">Lady Macbeth</name> receives <name type="person">Macbeth's</name> letter about the prophecies.</s>
        <s>There she already doubts his ability to such acts of violence because he has too much of the <quote>milk of human kindness</quote>.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Macbeth's</name> answer <quote>if we should fail</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 36)</ref>, a hesitant question, already shows that the lady's persistence was succesful.</s>
        <s>When at first he rather confidently stated to not <quote>proceed further</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 4)</ref> he now accepted her plan of the murder.</s>
        <s>Similarly, <name type="person">Lady Macbeth</name> now starts to include both of them in ther plans, since she is aware of his acceptance.</s>
        <s>She uses pronouns like <quote>we</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 39)</ref>, <quote>our</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 50)</ref> and <quote>you and I</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 47)</ref> to underline that he is not doing it alone and she's there to help and support him.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Before she used lots of negative connotated words like <quote>coward</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 18)</ref> <quote>beast</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 23)</ref> to pressure <name type="person">Macbeth</name>.</s>
        <s>Now that she noticed he her manipulations are working she wants to motivate him further.</s>
        <s>She describes her plan in great detail and uses more positive words like <quote>great</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 50)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Her alliteration in line 42 <quote>wine and wassail</quote> also helps to convey her plans and underline her ambitions for carrying it out.</s>
        <s>In the last part <name type="person">Macbeth</name> relents and in a way compliments her by saying that she may only <quote>bring forth men children</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 51)</ref>.</s>
        <s>So he indirectly says that she has the soul of a man and, referring to what she said before, is also more courageous, brave and coldblooded than he is.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>By his choice of words <quote>terrible feat</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 55)</ref> it is clear that he is not pleased or happy at killing the king, yet he still does it after his wife persuades him.</s>
        <s>His metaphor to <quote>mock the time with fairest show</quote> <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="line">(l. 56)</ref> show his willingness to deceive the world while also not quite believing in it.</s>
        <s>It could also possibly be a reference to the play, because it is supposed to be shown on stage.</s>
        <s>Furthermore this scene shows the dynamics between the two characters: <name type="person">Lady Macbeth</name> dominates the dialogue with accusations and manipulations while <name type="person">Macbeth</name>, troubled by his doubts, only defends himself.</s>
        <s>While <name type="person">Macbeth</name> is ambitious for power his self-doubts stop him and only through pressure from his wife he agrees to commit a crime.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all, <name type="person">Lady Macbeth</name>  persuades her husband in this scene by questioning his masculinity and uses imagery to help convey that mesasge.</s>
        <s>She pressures him into accepting her plan, by otherwise declaring him not a man if he is not willing to do such acts of violence.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Macbeth</name>, on the other hand, only defends himself after he is reprimanded.</s>
        <s>In the end he wants to please her, so he agrees to her plan.</s>
