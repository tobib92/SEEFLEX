        <s>When <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> walks out of the chamber his wife <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> follows him.</s>
        <s>She asks him why he left the room, but he refused, that he isn't sure.</s>

        <s>This shows the reader, that <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> has already gained a lot of glory, but <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Lady Macbeth</ref> is greedy and wants to get more power.</s>

        <s>These question should convince <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref>, that he could reach a much higher goal and he is not at the limits of his potentials.</s>

        <s>This paradox should make clear, that if <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Macbeth</ref> thinks sceptical, they will fail their plan.</s>
        <s>She wants to motivate him to kill <ref target="c12gk2_1" type="character">Duncan</ref> and finally manages to convince him, by talking about the plan again and explaining, that the plan couldn't fail if they make everything right.</s>
