        <s>I think the German linguist philosopher <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name> with his statement <quote>The limits of my language are the limits of my world</quote> is right.</s>
        <s>When one only speaks their mother tongue, one can only communicate in their native country.</s>
        <s>This means that their native country is <quote>the limit of [their] world</quote> because they do not speak other languages.</s>
