        <s>The text <ref target="c10gk1_1" type="title">Hope of escape lost in translation</ref> is written by <ref target="c10gk1_1" type="author">Zia Haider Rahman</ref> and published by the weekly newspaper <name type="misc">The Sunday Times</name> on <date>December 17th 2016</date>.</s>
        <s>The text begins with the surprising and shocking fact that translating British texts to languages of immigrants costs more then 100 million pounds.</s>
        <s>But then, the main point of the text is stated: Translating the texts doesn't help the migrants to speak <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>, and thus doesn't help integration.</s>
        <s>The example of <name type="misc">Brick Lane</name> in <name type="geo">London</name> supports this, there are Bangladeshis at the bottom of education, durg abuse, and crimes.</s>
        <s>The author himself sasy he didn't live there even as a migrant, because his parents and school helped him learn <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>The next point of critique is the way diversity is handled, the celebration of multiculturalness, which doesn't help integration.</s>
        <s>The author ends the text with the general statement that every problem need to be stand up against silence is acceptance.</s>
