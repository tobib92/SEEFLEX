        <s>I think the statement of <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name> that <quote>The limits of my language are the limits of my world</quote> is half true but also half false.</s>

      <p>
        <s>Nowadays a lot of people over the world learn <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> as <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> global <choice><orig>languag</orig><reg>language</reg></choice> <choice><orig>wich</orig><reg>which</reg></choice> is useful if you go <choice><orig>abroud</orig><reg>abroad</reg></choice> and more people are able to speak the same language.</s>
        <s>But if you exclude <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> it can be hard and difficult to communicate with foreign <choice><orig>poeple</orig><reg>people</reg></choice> and trying to understand each other which can also lead to misunderstandings.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>But apart from that there are also <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> ways to communicate or to help to understand, for example gestures can say a lot too.</s>
        <s>Also I think that people get more curious about <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> cultures through being more aware all over the world.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Maybe through these things people get more open minded to learn more about a <choice><orig>diffrent</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> language or general a <choice><orig>diffrend</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> culture.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion I guess it depends on the person who you are and who you are with on the way of learning about other countries, languages and cultures and how interested you are in <choice><orig>traveling</orig><reg>travelling</reg></choice> and such adventures.</s>
