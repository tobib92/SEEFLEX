        <s>Investing £100<choice><abbr>m</abbr><expan>million</expan></choice> for translators every year is completely unnecessary.</s>
        <s>If the £100<choice><abbr>m</abbr><expan>million</expan></choice> were spend in education <choice><orig>programms</orig><reg>programs</reg></choice>, would've helped better, because all immigrated citizens are learning it all by themselves, which helps to memorize it better and they can recieve help when needed.</s>
        <s>This option is also much cheaper because you only have to pay some school years.</s>
        <s>When they finished the school, they won't need any translator.</s>
        <s>By doing so, many money can be saved and invested into other things.</s>
