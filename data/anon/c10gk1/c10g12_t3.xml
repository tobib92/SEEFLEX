        <s>The <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> linguist philosopher <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name> once said <quote>The limits of my language are the limits of my world</quote>.</s>
        <s>In the following text I am <choice><orig>gonna</orig><reg>going to</reg></choice> tell you my opinion on this quotation.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>On the one hand I can understand <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name> because language is the main thing of communication, but on the other hand there are some helpful programs.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Surely you can argue that these programs take pains but you also have hands and feet so you can make the other person clear you do not understand him and if he can explain it slower.</s>

        <s>You should not forget that nowadays many people learn English as a second language and this is really important in such a globalized world with many languages.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Considering all the positive and negative <choice><orig>affects</orig><reg>effects</reg></choice>, I would say that English helps you to communicate and all in all I come to the conclusion that the limits of the langugae are not the limits of the world but a border.</s>
