        <s>The German linguist <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name> once said <quote>The limits of my language are the limits of my world</quote>.</s>
        <s>I'd like to tell you what this quotation means and how I think about it.</s>
        <s>It means that when you have reached the limits of your language, you can't communicate with others so your world can't grow.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name> has a point there, because in the modern globalized world, there is <choice><orig>nothink</orig><reg>nothing</reg></choice> more important than to communicate with others.</s>
        <s>When you can't communicate our whole world would stop evolving.</s>
        <s>There is the example when you are in holiday and you can't even <choice><orig>speek</orig><reg>speak</reg></choice> <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>, you can't ask for example for the way to the next restaurant or bus stop.</s>
        <s>So your language limits, limited your holidays.</s>
        <s>That is the same <choice><orig>think</orig><reg>thing</reg></choice> with the world.</s>
        <s>In many jobs you have to speak foreign languages.</s>
        <s>So when you reached your limits you can't make progress in your job or your <choice><orig>live</orig><reg>life</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>Everythink</orig><reg>Everything</reg></choice> is about communication and that can stop you from having success.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To sum up I think this quotation is right and in our globalized world it is one of the important <choice><orig>thinks</orig><reg>things</reg></choice> to speak foreign languages.</s>
