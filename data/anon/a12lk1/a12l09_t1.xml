        <s>Sonnet 138 by <ref target="a12lk1_1" type="author">William <choice><orig>Shakespear</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice></ref>, describes how the speaker relizes his/her aging process whereas his/her <choice><orig>adressed</orig><reg>addressed</reg></choice> love denies it.</s>
        <s>In the end the speaker claims that he/she wants to ignore worrying about aging and just enjoy and keep on loving the love the speaker has for the <choice><orig>adressed</orig><reg>addressed</reg></choice> person.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The first quatrain contains that the <choice><orig>adressed</orig><reg>addressed</reg></choice> person claims to be honest on every subject but the speaker knows tha he/she does not tell the truth about everything.</s>
        <s>For example, he/she denies the speaker's aging process.</s>
        <s>The speaker also speculates if his/her love thinks he/she has not experienced his/her youth that much.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The second quatrain continues with saying that the <choice><orig>adresse</orig><reg>addressee</reg></choice> ineffectually believes that the speaker is young and is still in his youth.</s>
        <s>Furthermore, the speaker explains that he/she knows how the <choice><orig>adresse</orig><reg>addressee</reg></choice> thinks about his/her glorious days, of being able to do anything as a human being are over.</s>
        <s>The speaker concludes how on both sides, the speaker as well as the <choice><orig>adresse</orig><reg>addressee</reg></choice> are suppressing the truth.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the last quatrain the speaker questions why both parties keep lying to each other.</s>
        <s>He/she believes that trust is the most important habit in a relationship.</s>
        <s>Therefore, the speaker realizes that people in <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> unforced and loving relationship do not want to <choice><orig>remaind</orig><reg>remind</reg></choice> themselves of their age and the time they have left.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The couplet summarizes how the speaker will continue to love the <choice><orig>adressed</orig><reg>addressed</reg></choice> person even with their flaws.</s>
