        <salute>Greetings fellow Shakespeare fans!</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Lately I've come across this article about how <name type="person">Shakespeare's</name> monument was built into the <name type="misc">Kurpark</name> in <name type="geo">Weimar</name> in <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>
        <s>The article talks about how <name type="person">Shakespeare's</name> work found its way into <name type="geo">Germany</name> and also the relationship of the city <name type="geo">Weimar</name> and <name type="person">Shakespeare</name>, it was published on <date>24th of April</date> in the German <choice><orig>Newslatter</orig><reg>newspaper</reg></choice> <name type="misc">Thüringer Allgemeine</name>.</s>
        <s>I personally think the article is very interesting and wanted to tell you about it by writing a blog post on our website.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>in the article it is said that in the German city <name type="geo">Weimar</name> <name type="person"><choice><orig>Shakespeares</orig><reg>Shakespeare's</reg></choice></name> work first started to circulate.</s>
        <s>Therefore the <name type="misc">German Shakespeare Society</name> was founded in <name type="geo">Weimar</name> 155 years ago in <date>1864</date>.</s>
        <s>The first man to ever translate the <choice><orig>poets</orig><reg>poet's</reg></choice> work into the German language what is the <quote>founding father of the German classical period</quote>, <name type="person">Christoph Martin Wieland</name>.</s>
        <s>His first translations appeared between <date>1762</date> and <date>1766</date> in <name type="geo">Zürich, Switzerland</name>.</s>
        <s>The first similarities can be found in <name type="person">Lessing's</name> work.</s>
        <s><name type="person">Wieland</name>, <name type="person">Goethe</name> and <name type="person">Herder</name>, all of them were participants of the so-called <name type="misc">Shakespeare Renaissance</name>.</s>
        <s>Accordingly <name type="person"><choice><orig>Shakespeares</orig><reg>Shakespeare's</reg></choice></name> work was also played at the <name type="misc">Royal Court Theatre</name> of <name type="geo">Weimar</name>.</s>
        <s>On the <name type="geo">grand duchess' Sophie's</name> birthday, the <quote><name type="person">Shakespeare</name> fanclub</quote> was constituted on the <choice><orig>poets</orig><reg>poet's</reg></choice> birth- and <choice><orig>death date</orig><reg>deathdate</reg></choice>, the <date>8th of April 1864</date>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>On the 40-year jubilee of the <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> Society, that was built the monument in the <name type="geo">Kurpark</name> in <name type="geo">Weimar</name>.</s>
        <s>This expensive honouring of <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> is regarded as the first monument of the poet in all of Europe.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope you enjoyed this blog post and are now even more convinced how global our beloved poet really is.</s>
        <s>As you have learned, <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> isn't only honoured in his home country, but has a strong relationship to <name type="geo">Weimar</name> and German literary culture, having influenced poets like <name type="person">Goethe</name> and <name type="person">Lessing</name>!</s>
