        <s>When researching about <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> and his connection to my home country <name type="geo">Germany</name>, I came across this very interesting newspaper article on how he first became known in <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>
        <s>According to a <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> professor, <name type="person">Klaus Manger</name>, <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> was unknown in the <name type="geo">Germany</name> of the late 18th century.</s>
        <s>There have been some of his influence in the works of <name type="person">Goethe</name> or <name type="person">Herder</name>, but <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> only truly made his way into <name type="geo">Germany</name> with a <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> writer <name type="person">Christoph Martin Wieland's</name> translations.</s>
        <s>Between <date>1762</date> and <date>1766</date>, <name type="person">Wieland</name> published translation of 22 of <name type="person">Shakespeare's</name> dramas.</s>
        <s>Especially present is and was <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> in <name type="geo">Weimar</name>, where on the <date>8th April 1864</date> <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> company was established.</s>
        <s>This happened after a few of <name type="person"><choice><orig>Shakespeares</orig><reg>Shakespeare's</reg></choice></name> histories were presented at the <name type="geo">Weimar</name> court in honour of his death.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>40 years later, on the <date>23rd April 1904</date>, in celebration of the company and 340 years after <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> was born, a memorial was <choice><orig>build</orig><reg>built</reg></choice> for him in a park in <name type="geo">Weimar</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>today there are a variety of <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> translations and he is still important not only in <name type="geo">Weimar</name> but everywhere in <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>

        <s>I hope this was interesting and informative and if you have any more good articles on this topic, do let me know in the comments.</s>
