        <s>Children learn in school about <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> and his plays and sonnet.</s>
        <s>But is he also relevant for young people or not.</s>
        <s>There are a lot of pros and cons.</s>
        <s>I will begin with the pros.</s>
        <s>So the <choice><orig>charakters</orig><reg>characters</reg></choice> in <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> plays are timeless for example Romeo and Juliet.</s>
        <s>The story of two humans which <choice><orig>loves</orig><reg>love</reg></choice> each other, but with parents which are <choice><orig>againt</orig><reg>against</reg></choice> this love.</s>
        <s>This topic is actuell and have a great influence on other plays, movies <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>and</reg></choice> <choice><orig>book</orig><reg>books</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>This is <choice><orig>an other</orig><reg>another</reg></choice> pro argument.</s>
        <s>The story of <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author"><choice><orig>Shakespears</orig><reg>Shakespeare's</reg></choice></ref> plays have a great influence on stories of today.</s>
        <s>An example for this is the <name type="misc">Lion King</name> which <choice><orig>have</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> elements of Hamlet.</s>
        <s>The stories of the <choice><orig>Shakespearen</orig><reg>Shakespearean</reg></choice> plays are also very good.</s>
        <s>They are so good, that also today where movies which have <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author"><choice><orig>Shakespears</orig><reg>Shakespeare's</reg></choice></ref> stories like Romeo and Juliet or Macbeth.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>An other</orig><reg>Another</reg></choice> pro argument is the influence of the <choice><orig>englissh</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> language.</s>
        <s><ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref><choice><orig>have</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> thousand of new words, like thou, which are very relevant for the English language.</s>
