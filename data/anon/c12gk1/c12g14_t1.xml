        <s>In the following I'm going to outline <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="title">Sonnet 116</ref> which was written by <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">William Shakespeare</ref> at the end of the 16th century.</s>
        <s>The sonnet is at the ending of <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> <choice><orig>sequenze</orig><reg>sequence</reg></choice> about the young men.</s>
        <s>The narrator of the sonnet speaks about his opinion of love.</s>
        <s>As a result he comes to the conclusion that after his opinion no one has ever loved.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the first quatrain he says that love is not transitory.</s>
        <s>It also shouldn't change with the time.</s>
        <s>There should never be obstacles in a good relationship.</s>
        <s>So the people should watch after this.</s>
        <s>In the next <choice><orig>quartrain</orig><reg>quatrain</reg></choice> the personal speaker describes <choice><orig>Love</orig><reg>love</reg></choice> as an option for finding the right way in life.</s>
        <s>Especially for people who don't know who their self are love gives them a good direction.</s>
        <s>They don't have to take the way <choice><orig>Love</orig><reg>love</reg></choice> says but they can.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><choice><orig>Quartrain</orig><reg>quatrain</reg></choice> number three says that real <choice><orig>Love</orig><reg>love</reg></choice> never <choice><orig>get</orig><reg>gets</reg></choice> lost or <choice><orig>change</orig><reg>changes</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>If love is transitory it's not because of the time.</s>
        <s>Real love exists until being death.</s>
        <s>The closing couplet is about the paradox of the personal speaker.</s>
        <s>After his definition of love he comes to the conclusion that no one ever loved.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="title">Sonnet 116</ref> is about the idea of love from the personal speaker.</s>
        <s>The problem is that his point of view isn't realistic.</s>
