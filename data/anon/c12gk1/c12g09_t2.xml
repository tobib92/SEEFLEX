        <s>The sonnet is written in the typical <choice><orig>Shakesperean</orig><reg>Shakespearean</reg></choice> structure.</s>
        <s>It contains 14 lines which are <choice><orig>seperated</orig><reg>separated</reg></choice> and three quatrains and a final couplet.</s>
        <s>The rhyme scheme is <name type="misc">ababcdcdefefgg</name>.</s>
        <s>The structure supports the author's intention because it describes the false love at first, then the true love and that it survives even the death and finally shows the speakers view on the steam, that only the true love deserves to be named love.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The author's idea of love is also supported through language and stylistic devices.</s>
        <s>There is a metaphor at the beginning that shows how the speaker does not want <quote>the marriage of true minds</quote> <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 1)</ref>, therefore an arranged marriage for money or social benefits.</s>
        <s>He thinks a marriage should take place not because of logical causes but only because two people love each other.</s>
        <s>With this thoughts, he was very alone and futuristic in his time.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Moreover, there are two enjambments in the first quatrain <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(cf. ll 1-3)</ref>.</s>
        <s>They cause the flow of reading in the reader's mind but are also used to underline the first parts of the sentences which are very important for the topic of the sonnet.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the first quatrain or also two parallelisms.</s>
        <s>The false love <quote>alters when it alteration finds/or bends with the remover to remove</quote> <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 3-4)</ref> and is therefore nither constant nor good for the one who is loving.</s>
        <s>It changes or desappears fast and without real reason and cannot last when the couple is <choice><orig>seperated</orig><reg>separated</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>The second quatrain begins with the fact that the true love does not work like that and is underlined by an exclamation mark to state the huge difference <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(cf. l. 5)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Then the true love is described with <choice><orig>treats</orig><reg>traits</reg></choice> of a landmark <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(cf. ll. 5-8)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This metaphor shows how the true love cannot be destroyed by arguments or problems in a relationship and that it is unbreakable ones it exists.</s>
        <s>It is always there and a constant and reliable feeling that can be reached by everyone.</s>
        <s>Even if its value cannot be measured, everyone desires it and wants to experience this mystery.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>After that, the speaker uses the personification that <quote>Love's not Time's fool</quote> <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 9)</ref> to say true love will not become weaker afer years.</s>
        <s>The <quote>rosy lips and cheeks</quote> <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 9)</ref> are a symbol for the beauty and the loving power of the loved one, who will die one day through the death that is described with the symbol of the classic sickle the personated death carries <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(cf. l. 10)</ref>.</s>
        <s>So it says that the person who is loved will die one day, but the love will survive and will be part of the lover forever.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Furthermore, the speaker uses a comparison between the understatement of the <quote>brief hours and weeks</quote> <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 12)</ref> to show that love is not influenced by the time to become less powerful but only gets stronger and more intensive.</s>
        <s><quote>The edge of doom</quote> is also used as a metaphor to say that the true love lasts for the infinity.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The final couplet does not describe the two kinds of love but contains the speaker's view and experience.</s>
        <s>He says all he has written is a lie and no one ever loved before if there once will be a proof that true love does not exist.</s>
        <s>It sounds like he is very sure he is right and therefore can use this great exaggeration without getting consequences.</s>
        <s>Furthermore, the final couplet makes the whole sonnet being alike a story or a short telling.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all, <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> wanted to show that true love exists and differs from the love that it is experienced more often.</s>
        <s>She thinks true love is the most desirable attribute or feeling humans can reach and says he himself knows it through the love to the young man.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In this sonnet, the symbol for the love is a constant, everlasting landmark that cannot be destroyed.</s>
        <s>It survives even death and long times of <choice><orig>seperation</orig><reg>separation</reg></choice> and <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> is so convinced by this view he is brave enough to see all his writings value nothing if his described true love does not exist.</s>
