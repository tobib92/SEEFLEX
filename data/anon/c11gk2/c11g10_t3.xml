        <s><quote>Brexit is clearly a lose-lose situation for both</quote>, that is what <ref target="c11gk2_1" type="speaker">Michel Barnier</ref> was saying in his speech at the <name type="misc">European American Chamber of Commerce</name>.</s>
        <s>But, is he right?</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the following I will comment on this assumption.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my point of view he is absolutely right!</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The <name type="geo">UK</name> <choice><orig>officielly</orig><reg>officially</reg></choice> left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on <date>31 January 2020</date>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It was a complex and sometimes bitter negotiation but finally they agreed a deal on <date>24 December</date> for rules how the <name type="geo">UK</name> and the <name type="misc">EU</name> will live, work and trade together.</s>
        <s>Nevertheless, the open market system is the best trading system in the world.</s>
        <s>Subsequently, we can say the <name type="geo">UK</name> lost trading partners and lots of profit.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So, as <ref target="c11gk2_1" type="speaker">Michel Barnier</ref> said, there is definitely a lose.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Some parts of the <name type="geo">UK</name>, for example <name type="geo">Northern Ireland</name>, have to continue to follow many rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with <name type="geo">Republic of Ireland</name>.</s>
        <s>That is a lost too.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To sum up, they lost and will <choice><orig>loose</orig><reg>lose</reg></choice> profit in aim to be free.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In worst case they will end like <name type="geo">Northern Ireland</name>.</s>
