        <s>In the following text I am going to comment on this and tell my opinion.</s>

      <p>
        <s>I personally think there are many pros and cons of leaving the <name type="misc">EU</name> but for me I think not leaving the <name type="misc">EU</name> is the better way.</s>
        <s>The trading system in the <name type="misc">EU</name> is very good and it is the most legal open market that you could be in.</s>
        <s>The <name type="geo">UK</name> would benefits very well from the <name type="misc">EU</name>.</s>
        <s>Also the system is very good.</s>
        <s>But I think it is not a complete lose-lose situation.</s>
        <s>The <name type="geo">UK</name> gets many new chances and can find new trading partners.</s>
        <s>Also they can invest more money for their system and decide over everything.</s>
        <s>The <name type="misc">EU</name> <choice><orig>dosn't</orig><reg>doesn't</reg></choice> get very benefits from the <name type="misc">Brexit</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To sum it up I would say that the <name type="geo">UK</name> also wins things from the <name type="misc">Brexit</name> and that it is not a complete lose-lose.</s>
