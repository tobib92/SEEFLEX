        <s>In his speech <ref target="c11gk2_1" type="speaker">Barnier</ref> states, that <quote>Brexit is clearly a lose-lose situation for both</quote> the <name type="misc">EU</name> and the <name type="geo">UK</name>, which is a controverse statement.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The first part, that <name type="misc">Brexit</name> is a lose for the <name type="geo">UK</name> is undisputably true, so there is only need to argue, if the <name type="geo">UK</name> leaving is a lose for the <name type="misc">EU</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><choice><orig>Loosing</orig><reg>Losing</reg></choice> a member means a reduced tax income for the <name type="misc">EU</name>, and also a lost trade partner, but it also means that there is less income to spend on the <name type="geo">UK</name>, meaning it still has some positives.</s>
        <s>But the positives are vastly smaller than the downsides, which also include the economic disturbance and less freedoms, like free travel across <name type="geo">Europe</name> as a whole.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So I think, that while some may disagree, all in all <name type="misc">Brexit</name> was a lose-lose situation, even if the <name type="geo">UK</name> suffered a lot more than the <name type="misc">EU</name>.</s>
