        <s>today was a pretty bad day, <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> got in an argument with my uncle.</s>
        <s>I just can't understand, how it's possible for him to <choice><orig>supress</orig><reg>suppress</reg></choice> his heritage and identity.</s>
        <s>Doesn't he have any pride for his religion or culture?</s>
        <s>He always <choice><orig>want's</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> to take the easiest way and <choice><orig>don't</orig><reg>doesn't</reg></choice> <choice><orig>want's</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> any trouble.</s>
        <s>But sometimes you have to get in trouble, to show up the unfairness, that is existing in this country.</s>
        <s>I mean even if he really does not want to be muslim anymore, he gotta get my point of view.</s>
        <s>He gotta understand that not everyone <choice><orig>want's</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> to handle his problems the way he does.</s>
        <s>And especially as my uncle he should understand and support me more.</s>

        <s>But no, the authorities make the rules and you have to do everything what they say, otherwise you'll get deported...</s>

        <s>Will he always do, what everyone says, to stay out of trouble?</s>
        <s>He can't do that for his whole future.</s>
        <s>And <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> will not do that and if that means <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> will get deported, then <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> know, that <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> will have a better future in <name type="geo">Pakistan</name>.</s>
        <s>I just don't think, that this country has a good future for anyone of my religion...</s>
