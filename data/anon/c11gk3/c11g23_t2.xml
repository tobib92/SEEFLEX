        <s>In the following task, I will have a closer look on the <choice><orig>dialoge</orig><reg>dialogue</reg></choice> between <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter</ref> and his wife <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Right in the beginning of the extract of the scene, you can mention that <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter</ref> is not really interested in that what <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth</ref> <choice><orig>say</orig><reg>says</reg></choice> to his dream.</s>
        <s>You can see this when <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter</ref> ignores her when talking about <quote>he was thinking in the bathroom</quote> <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="line">(l. 1-3)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Also he is directly stressed, when <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth</ref> starts to say her opinion about <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter's</ref> friends, like <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Willy Harris</ref> <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="line">(l. 5-7)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The next thing is that <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter</ref> tries to <choice><orig>confince</orig><reg>convince</reg></choice> his wife to also find <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Walters</orig><reg>Walter's</reg></choice></ref> <choice><orig>Dream</orig><reg>dream</reg></choice> attractive and a good invest of the money.</s>
        <s>Here he asks <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth</ref> questions like <quote>You tired, ain't you [...] but you wouldn't do nothing to help, would you?</quote> <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="line">(l. 11-13)</ref>.</s>
        <s>So he uses these <choice><orig>question</orig><reg>questions</reg></choice> to <choice><orig>rember</orig><reg>remember</reg></choice> her that they <choice><orig>buth</orig><reg>both</reg></choice> feel the same about their current life-situation.</s>
        <s>These few lines are used to give an introduction of his clear goal that <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth</ref> talks with <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Mama</ref> about <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter's</ref> dream, to <choice><orig>confince</orig><reg>convince</reg></choice> her, she should spend the money on the liquor store and with that letting <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter's</ref> dream come true.</s>
        <s>In this try he also demonstrates how he thinks the talk between <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Mama</ref> and <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth</ref> should be <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="line">(l. 20-21)</ref>.</s>
        <s>His hope is that <quote><s>Mama would listen to you <add>(Ruth)</add>.</s><s>You know she listen to you more than she do me and Bennie</s></quote> <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="line">(l. 18)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The whole part of the extract from line 16 to 25, is his main mean to have a chance of realizing his dream, bringing in his wife as a <quote>mouthpiece</quote> of his idea to spend the money of the paycheck <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Mama</ref> is about to receive.</s>
        <s>In the last part of the extract, <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter</ref> is really upset with the reaction of his wife, which was <quote><s>Walter leave me alone!</s><s>Eat your eggs, they gonna be cold</s></quote>.</s>
        <s>Here he shows his impatience with her reaction, with showing his <choice><orig>perspectife</orig><reg>perspective</reg></choice> in a <choice><orig>generall</orig><reg>general</reg></choice> way, saying <quote><s>Man say to his woman: [...].</s><s>His woman say: Eat your eggs</s></quote>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Comparing <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Walter's</ref> <choice><orig>Dream</orig><reg>dream</reg></choice> with the dreams of the other family members you can mention, that his dream is a very unstable one.</s>
        <s>When the idea, getting profit out of the liquor store, flops, all the 10000 dollar are gone.</s>
        <s>Then the family has given away their best chance to improve their living conditions and their overall money situation.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>When you have a look on <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Ruth's</ref> or <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Mama's</ref> dream, you can say that their dreams have a way better worth for all the family members, especially for the young boy <ref target="c11gk3_1" type="character">Travis</ref>, which then doesn't have to sleep in the living room anymore, when they all move into a bigger <choice><orig>appartment</orig><reg>apartment</reg></choice> or a house.</s>
