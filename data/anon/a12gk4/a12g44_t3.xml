        <s><ref target="a12gk4_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> wrote in his article <quote>language learning is vital for the UK's future prosperity and global standing</quote> and thinks that more young people should learn foreign languages.</s>

      <p>
        <s>With the ongoing of globalisation, this might be important, since communication between international companies is important without this, even the <choice><orig>most smallest</orig><reg>smallest</reg></choice> would not work, since most of the parts are produced in <choice><orig>asian</orig><reg>Asian</reg></choice> <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>Suure</orig><reg>Sure</reg></choice>, most of the people learn English, but what if not?</s>
        <s>You might have your <choice><orig>translator-App</orig><reg>translator-app</reg></choice> but they do not work <choice><orig>allways</orig><reg>always</reg></choice> and many could consider it rude to use one of these.</s>
        <s>In <choice><orig>generall</orig><reg>general</reg></choice>: many foreign cultures and even Europeans like it when you speak their language.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>For many it is a thing of politeness, you could say even in the <name type="geo">UK</name> or the <name type="geo">USA</name>.</s>
        <s>In the <name type="geo">USA</name> most of the people expect you to speak <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>Yes, English is a <choice><orig>world-language</orig><reg>world language</reg></choice>, but the feeling is still the same, despite the fact that there are more people speaking Chinese.</s>
        <s>It might be true that for us <choice><orig>germans</orig><reg>Germans</reg></choice> English is more important, since more people speak it and we can communicate with them, but for a native <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> speaker, another language might be helpful.</s>
        <s>It is especially helpful if you have to go there.</s>
        <s>Not everybody understands <name type="misc"><choice><orig>google-translator</orig><reg>Google Translate</reg></choice></name> and you do not have always a phone signal so <choice><orig>reling</orig><reg>relying</reg></choice> on that is like not packing <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> emergency parachute while parachute jumping.</s>
        <s>It is also more safe, since these apps <choice><orig>does</orig><reg>do</reg></choice> not always work, and, as <ref target="a12gk4_1" type="author">Worne</ref> pointed out, reading road signs with your app while driving, can be difficult.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>One thing was not pointed out language learning is also helping your intellectual <choice><orig>abilitys</orig><reg>abilities</reg></choice> and on a CV it looks great, if you can say you speak <choice><orig>annother</orig><reg>another</reg></choice> language.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So in the end it could be said that it is <choice><orig>helpfull</orig><reg>helpful</reg></choice> to learn <choice><orig>annother</orig><reg>another</reg></choice> language.</s>
