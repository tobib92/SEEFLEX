        <s>Just like <ref target="a12gk4_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> <choice><orig>sayes</orig><reg>says</reg></choice> in his article languages are important for <quote><choice><orig>trad</orig><reg>trade</reg></choice>, prosperity, cultural exports, diplomacy and national security</quote> <ref target="a12gk4_1" type="line">(ll. 26)</ref> and overall just communication.</s>
        <s>I agree with that because the future is depending on all of that and more developing around the world.</s>
        <s>Yes, English is <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> world language but that doesn't say that the other ones are not as important or <choice><orig>usefull</orig><reg>usefull</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>In these <choice><orig>dayes</orig><reg>days</reg></choice> we are living in the highest <choice><orig>aria</orig><reg>area</reg></choice> of cultural export and trading and it is vital to knwow how to communicate.</s>
        <s>We have the great opportunity to communicate with people all around the world <choice><orig>trough out</orig><reg>throughout</reg></choice> social media and it would be a big loss to not get the chance to get to know different <choice><orig>countrys</orig><reg>countries</reg></choice> just because of a lack of communication skills.</s>
        <s>It is also important for the <choice><orig>futur</orig><reg>future</reg></choice> job of many students.</s>
        <s>First of all it is more in demand <ref target="a12gk4_1" type="line">(cf. ll. 42)</ref>, on the other hand is outsourcing a big theme these days.</s>
        <s>It is more and more <choice><orig>commun</orig><reg>common</reg></choice> that someone is getting <choice><orig>transfert</orig><reg>transferred</reg></choice> to another country to work there and then it is a huge <choice><orig>atwantes</orig><reg>advantage</reg></choice> to know the language or being <choice><orig>abele</orig><reg>able</reg></choice> to learn a new language.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion I agree with the author, because the language is a big and <choice><orig>valiuble</orig><reg>valuable</reg></choice> <choice><orig>communicatio</orig><reg>communication</reg></choice> skill that we all should develop.</s>
