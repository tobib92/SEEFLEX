        <s>Damn, that was an exhausting discussion!</s>
        <s>I am glad <name type="person">Karl</name> did not started a new argument after I freaked out.</s>

      <p>
        <s>All of these community members just simply do not respect new neighbours, we should better warn the new house keepers... well, better not, or we will never sell this house.</s>

        <s>I have to be honest with myself.</s>
        <s>I must admit that I really triggered <name type="person">Bev</name> with reading out our son's last letter.</s>
        <s>Definitely have to tell to her!</s>
        <s>Maybe I exaggerated a bit.</s>

      <p>
        <s>Also have to say sorry to <name type="person">Jim</name>, really have to excuse myself for being that mean.</s>
        <s>Still wanna sell this house, so I need a trustful local clergyman.</s>

        <s><kinesic><desc>Hmm</desc></kinesic> what about <name type="person">Karl</name>.</s>
        <s>Such a dumbass.</s>
        <s>Really looking forward saying goodbye to him forever.</s>
        <s>When I meet him the next time at <name type="misc">Gelman's</name> with <name type="person">Bev</name>, I am going to ignore him.</s>
        <s>Would be better like this.</s>
