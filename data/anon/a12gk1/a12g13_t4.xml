        <salute>Dear Eliora,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>We haven't talked for ages but that you sent me the last email about living in <name type="geo">Germany</name> short <choice><orig>tearms</orig><reg>terms</reg></choice> made me really happy.</s>
        <s><choice><orig>Althoug</orig><reg>Although</reg></choice> I don't live in <name type="geo">Berlin</name> I researched a little bit and got to the point where I think it would be the right choice for you.</s>
        <s>I may just have to visit you there.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I found out that many people in <name type="geo">Berlin</name> speak English or other foreign languages so for you it would be an <choice><orig>oportunity</orig><reg>opportunity</reg></choice> to meet different people, learn new languages but also be in a safe <choice><orig>soraunding</orig><reg>surrounding</reg></choice> where you'll be understood.</s>
        <s>Furthermore many British, Australian and American people visit <name type="geo">Berlin</name> and it's more <choice><orig>simmilar</orig><reg>similar</reg></choice> to <name type="geo">London</name>, <name type="geo">Brooklyn</name> and <name type="geo">Sydney</name> <choice><orig>then</orig><reg>than</reg></choice> to the rest of <name type="geo">Germany</name> so you should find yourself in a familiar <choice><orig>souroundings</orig><reg>surrounding</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>What may interest you is that many people just visit and <choice><orig>theirfore</orig><reg>therefore</reg></choice> also need to <choice><orig>fiend</orig><reg>find</reg></choice> friends.</s>
        <s>Some of them stay though.</s>
        <s>Maybe it'll be you but if not maybe you'll get new friends in <name type="geo">Germany</name> that you can visit.</s>
        <s>If you visit <name type="geo">Neuk√∂lln</name>, <name type="geo">Kreuzberg</name> or <name type="geo">Mitte</name> you can find exotic food and meet different people so maybe that could be fun.</s>
        <s>Some parts of <name type="geo">Berlin</name> also <choice><orig>requier</orig><reg>require</reg></choice> you to speak <choice><orig>english </orig><reg>English</reg></choice> so you'll meet all your people there.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Because of the <choice><orig>Globalisation</orig><reg>globalisation</reg></choice> <name type="geo"><choice><orig>Berlins</orig><reg>Berlin's</reg></choice></name> <choice><orig>shopps</orig><reg>shops</reg></choice> could also be found in your home town so you'll feel a little more <choice><orig>includet</orig><reg>included</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>and if you want to start working you'll always have the opportunity because language is not a problem.</s>
        <s>People also come to <name type="geo">Berlin</name> to live their dreams and so should you.</s>
        <s>Over here we've got art, culture, nightlife and in <choice><orig>comperison</orig><reg>comparison</reg></choice> to other global cities low rents.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I would love to see you over here and introduce you to my friends.</s>
        <s>So above all of these good points I just told you I hope I'm the main reason you come over and visit.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope you and your family are all good.</s>
        <s>Send best regards to everyone.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Lots of love,</s>
