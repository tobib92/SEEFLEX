        <s><ref target="a12gk1_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> outlines that the ability to think get lost as well as the grades and language qualifications in school.</s>
        <s>One reason for this can be the phones of students as <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="author">Worne</ref><ref target="a12gk1_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> say.</s>

        <s>Another point from <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="author">John</ref> is that foreign language is needed in economy.</s>
        <s>So if the language skill went down, the economy will go down as well.</s>
        <s>On the other hand <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> wants more people to use the option to learn a language during learning a different subject.</s>
        <s>At the end of his artucle he tells parents that they should have more thoughts about language to get a better system of education.</s>
