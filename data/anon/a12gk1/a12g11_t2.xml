      </p>
      <p>
        <s>A parallelism like in line 16 and 17 can be used to clear out the point of view, because in some way it can also be a repetition which burns in your head so you do not forget the point.</s>
        <s>Also the author makes use of a an enumeration and an increasing enumeration.</s>
        <s>For example in l. 1 <quote>can't, won't, don't</quote> and line 17 <quote>trade, [...] national security</quote>.</s>
