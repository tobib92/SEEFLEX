        <salute>Dear Sam,</salute>

        <s>my name is <name type="person">Jane</name>.</s>
        <s>I am a student here.</s>
        <s>You asked if school without racism can exist and I found an article where that was explained.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><quote>School without racism, and school with courage</quote> is the biggest <choice><orig>schoolnetwork</orig><reg>school network</reg></choice> of <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>
        <s>According to the article more than 3000 schools have this label.</s>
        <s>The <name type="misc"><choice><abbr>School A</abbr><expan>School A</expan></choice></name> is one of them.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><name type="person">Karim Fereidooni</name> says that schools without racism do not exist but every student and teacher could try to speak up or to do something to keep the racism as small as possible.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>He also says that everywhere, where people come together the structures are unequal in many different ways.</s>
        <s>In school it is a problem that a few students get graded in an unfair way.</s>
        <s>There was a study called <name type="misc">Max vs. Murat</name>.</s>
        <s><name type="misc">Max</name> is a very common <choice><orig>german</orig><reg>German</reg></choice> name and <name type="misc">Murat</name> is a common <choice><orig>turkish</orig><reg>Turkish</reg></choice> name.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>They found out that the test from the kid with the <choice><orig>turkish</orig><reg>Turkish</reg></choice> name was graded in an unfair way.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To solve the problem we first have to raise awareness and explain to the students what is going on.</s>
        <s>That is how we could minimise the amount of racism.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It is very important that <choice><orig>noone</orig><reg>no one</reg></choice> denies that racism at schools exist because the only way to overcome it is if we face the problem.</s>
        <s>Often people do not realise that they are racist or that something racist is happening.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Hopefully you decide to visit the <name type="misc"><choice><abbr>School A</abbr><expan>School A</expan></choice></name>.</s>
        <s>Then we could talk about that issue a little more.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I am looking forward to meeting you.</s>
