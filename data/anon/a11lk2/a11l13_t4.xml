        <salute>Dear John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>How are you?</s>
        <s>Thank you for your email about the label <name type="misc">school without racism, school with <choice><orig>curage</orig><reg>courage</reg></choice></name>.</s>
        <s>Yesterday I found an article about it and I wanted to share the information I got with you!</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Firstly, I want to tell you that there are over 3000 schools with this label in <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think that the act against racism is an important topic at school that should be discussed more in school.</s>
        <s>We need to change that inequality into equality!</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>That we have the label at the <name type="misc"><choice><abbr>School A</abbr><expan>School A</expan></choice></name> is a good first step.</s>
        <s>Maybe one day we can <choice><orig>fullfill</orig><reg>fulfill</reg></choice> the label.</s>
        <s>But to do so we have to do something against <choice><orig>subconsious</orig><reg>subconscious</reg></choice> daily racism.</s>
        <s>In the study <name type="misc">Max against Murat</name> they embrace the problem on an example.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><name type="misc">Max</name> and <name type="misc">Murat</name> make the same mistakes in a test but <name type="misc"><choice><orig>Murats</orig><reg>Murat's</reg></choice></name> grade isn't as good as the grade of <name type="misc">Max</name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>We learn to be racist in books, and even movies.</s>
        <s>In a <name type="misc">Walt Disney</name> movie the <choice><orig>dump</orig><reg>dumb</reg></choice> and silly role is presented by someone black.</s>
        <s>Is that fair?</s>
        <s>No!</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think a good step against this <choice><orig>subconsious</orig><reg>subconscious</reg></choice> racism is to never ever deny racism.</s>
        <s>Do you agree?</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Nevertheless stay well and see you soon!</s>
      </p>
