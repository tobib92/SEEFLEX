        <s>I heard you are going to study at the <name type="misc"><choice><abbr>School A</abbr><expan>School A</expan></choice></name> next year.</s>
        <s>You must be so excited and I wanted to tell you something about <name type="misc">school without racism and school with courage</name>.</s>
        <s>This is a label which German schools get if <choice><orig>the</orig><reg>they</reg></choice> raise <choice><orig>awernes</orig><reg>awareness</reg></choice> towards racism.</s>
        <s>It doesn't mean that those schools don't have any racism at all because that is not <choice><orig>posible</orig><reg>possible</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>By now over 3000 schools already have this <choice><orig>lable</orig><reg>label</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>This <choice><orig>lable</orig><reg>label</reg></choice> was created because <choice><orig>studys</orig><reg>studies</reg></choice> show that children with non German sounding names get worse marks than kids with German sounding names <choice><orig>altough</orig><reg>although</reg></choice> they have the same amount of <choice><orig>mistaces</orig><reg>mistakes</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Racism gets already <choice><orig>thought</orig><reg>taught</reg></choice> in little kids by for example movies when black people are portrayed as stupid.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>This never accured to me and I think that we should raise more <choice><orig>awerness</orig><reg>awareness</reg></choice> towards daily racism.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope that I can help you with this <choice><orig>E-mail</orig><reg>e-mail</reg></choice> and I am so excited that you are coming to <name type="geo">Germany</name>.</s>
