        <s>The question if I would agree with this statement is not as easy as I first thought.</s>

        <s>First of all I think you can be more <choice><orig>successfull</orig><reg>successful</reg></choice> than 50 years ago.</s>
        <s>People now are nicer to each other than earlier and they also have now the idea of the American Dream.</s>

        <s>So I can clearly say that in my point of view people in <name type="geo">America</name> have today more chances to success than 50 years ago, but there are still problems in <name type="geo">America</name>.</s>

        <s>All in all I would say that in <name type="geo">America</name> are still barriers to success, but compared to earlier you can clearly see differences.</s>
        <s>There is still discrimination, but <choice><orig>definetly</orig><reg>definitely</reg></choice> less than 50 years ago.</s>
        <s>For example the people there can all use the same bus or train and there is no <choice><orig>seperation</orig><reg>separation</reg></choice>, but still you can see that some people do not accept other people and discriminate them for, in my opinion stupid, reasons.</s>
