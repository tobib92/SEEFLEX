        <s>It <choice><orig>sybolizes</orig><reg>symbolizes</reg></choice> that him and the audience are no strangers.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>One of the most powerful rhetorical devices is a recurrent contrast.</s>
        <s><ref target="a11gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> emphasizes, that <quote>In big cities and small towns, among man and woman, young and old, black, white and brown</quote> the faith into common dreams is the same.</s>

        <s>While telling his family's story he explains the <quote>dreams that drove my mother</quote>.</s>
        <s>Equally his mother and grandparents chased their own dreams and worked hard to make them reality.</s>
        <s>This underlines their same passion and similarities, whether they had <choice><orig>differnt</orig><reg>different</reg></choice> dreams.</s>
