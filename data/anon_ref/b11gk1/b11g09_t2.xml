        <s>Besides she's a mysterious girl because nobody can follow her way of thinking <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 22-23)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Also she talks much.</s>
        <s>This shows us that she's doesn't a shy person <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 5)</ref>, but for the most people she's strange because she talks to herself in the third person, which shosw that she's different to other people and <choice><orig>particulary</orig><reg>particularly</reg></choice> at a children <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 17)</ref>.</s>

        <s><ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> lived in many foster homes and doesn't really know something about her past and her origin family.</s>
        <s>This probably means that she's maybe sad because she doesn't know her origin family and didn't get enough live because she moved into many foster homes and didn't live many years in a foster home <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 11-12 and 6)</ref>.</s>

        <s>She doesn't know something about her origin family and thinks that her foster home <choice><orig>familys</orig><reg>families</reg></choice> are her real family because she tells that she has two mothers and many brothers and sisters <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 6-10)</ref>.</s>
