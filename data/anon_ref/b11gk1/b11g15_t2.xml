        <s>As we have learned in the first exercise, the excerpt taken from the novel <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="title">Gun Love</ref>, by <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="author">Jennifer Clement</ref> and published in <date>2019</date>, deals with <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref>, a lonely foster child who has never experienced real love and care.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> is a very tiny eight year old girl <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. ll. 1-2)</ref>.</s>
        <s>She is so small that she <quote>looked about five</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 2)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>There is no existing family or a real friend.</s>
        <s><ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> has <quote>no idea who she (is) or where she (comes) from</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 5-6)</ref>.</s>
        <s>The fact that she invents all the time new family members and places where she so-called lived <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. ll. 6-10)</ref>, shows, how much she dreams of a family.</s>
        <s>It underlines her loneliness.</s>
        <s>In addition to that, <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> invents very special things about her past: that she had for example <quote>Jehova's Witness homes</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 10)</ref>.</s>
        <s>She tries to say something interesting.</s>
        <s>To get attention on the one hand and to underline her special past and experiences on the other hand.</s>
        <s>With this, the author intends to convey the impression that she actually is a very lonely person, but tries to be <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>as</reg></choice> positive she can.</s>
        <s><ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> has <quote>at least seventeen phones</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 26)</ref> of her past foster homes because everybody says she should stay in touch, it can be assumed that they do not expect and want it actually.</s>
        <s>The problem is, that <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> does not know which phone belongs to which house <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. l. 28)</ref>.</s>
      </p>

        <s>These facts show how much <choice><orig>lifes</orig><reg>lives</reg></choice> and houses she had.</s>
        <s>Every was the same.</s>
        <s>But <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> has kept them, she does not want to leave her past families go.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In addition to that she does not have real friends.</s>

        <s>But by the fact that she wants to talk with them about topics like <quote>do you like cats?</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 34)</ref> you can assume that these friends are only inventions of her head.</s>
        <s>You do not ask friends questions like this, when you are this close.</s>
        <s>These characteristic shows how much <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> searches for relationships with other people.</s>
        <s>For people in her surrounding, her lies are probably not a sign of evilness, they are rather sad.</s>
        <s>When a <choice><orig>humen</orig><reg>human</reg></choice> being invents this much about his life it <choice><orig>get</orig><reg>gets</reg></choice> obvious how lonely and sad her or she is.</s>

      <p>
        <s>She also has no siblings.</s>
        <s>The other foster children are important to her, she tries to be very close to them <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. l. 41)</ref>.</s>

        <s>In general, how she seems to other people, <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> is a very sweet person.</s>

        <s>With this she uses the marshmallows as a symbol.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>When you analyse her behaviour, her most dominant characteristic you have to focus on is the fact that she <quote>(talks) nonstop</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 5)</ref>.</s>
        <s>You can assume that through her loneliness she <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> stand quietness.</s>
        <s>She does not really wait for answers <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. ll. 22-23)</ref>, she is used to talk with herself in the <quote>third person</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 17)</ref>.</s>
        <s>This shows through how much she has gone through and that her talking is her way to come to terms with what happened and to defend the loneliness.</s>

      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The fact that <quote>nobody (correct) her</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 17)</ref> to not speak in the third person of herself, underlines again that nobody really <choice><orig>look</orig><reg>looks</reg></choice> after her.</s>
        <s>Nobody has teached her even essential things and knowledges in life <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. ll. 12-13)</ref>.</s>
        <s>She had to get <choice><orig>creatif</orig><reg>creative</reg></choice> herself <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. l. 21)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The fact that <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> searches for love can be proven through several aspects.</s>
        <s>She <quote>feels better after a shower</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 20)</ref>.</s>
        <s>A shower is warm, comfortable, maybe for her it is a replace for a real hug, which <choice><orig>make</orig><reg>makes</reg></choice> you feel warm too.</s>

      <p>
        <s>Also by the fact that <quote>(she) loves forehead kisses</quote> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(l. 19)</ref>, you can assume that she searches for love.</s>
        <s>Another idea is that she not only likes cats <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. ll. 34-35)</ref>, she may really identify herself with them <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="line">(comp. l. 42)</ref>.</s>
