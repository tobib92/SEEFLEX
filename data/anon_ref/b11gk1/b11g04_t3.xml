        <s>Now I'm going to comment on the statement <quote>CPS should have taken Pearl away from Margot and the trailer park, put her into a foster home and help her to get a good education and prepare for a better and independent way of life</quote>.</s>

        <s>On the other hand, it maybe <choice><orig>help</orig><reg>helps</reg></choice> <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> to have better conditions for a better life in the future, because now she <choice><orig>live</orig><reg>lives</reg></choice> in a real house instead of a car and <choice><orig>have</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> a roof over her head.</s>
        <s>She could meet as many friends as she <choice><orig>want</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice>, because she isn't more afraid of the <choice><abbr>CPS</abbr><expan>Child Protective Services</expan></choice>.</s>
        <s>On the other hand, <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Margot</ref> and <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> maybe had their own American Dream at the <name type="misc">Indian Waters Trailer Park</name>, <choice><orig>beause</orig><reg>because</reg></choice> of <choice><orig>there</orig><reg>their</reg></choice> life in freedom.</s>
        <s>They had everything they need and lived their life how they want.</s>
        <s>The only problem was that <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref> <choice><orig>haven't</orig><reg>hasn't</reg></choice> the best conditions for her future and for finding a good <choice><orig>Job</orig><reg>job</reg></choice> to have enough money to live her life.</s>
        <s>Another point is, if you look at <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref>, who lived in 17 different foster <choice><orig>home's</orig><reg>homes</reg></choice>, the same thing could happen to <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Pearl</ref>, so she <choice><orig>haven't</orig><reg>hasn't</reg></choice> a stability life because she <choice><orig>have</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> to switch her home very often.</s>
        <s>For example <ref target="b11gk1_1" type="character">Helen</ref> isn't that happy with her <choice><orig>Situation</orig><reg>situation</reg></choice> of <choice><orig>live</orig><reg>life</reg></choice>, but nevertheless <choice><orig>don't</orig><reg>doesn't</reg></choice> stop to live her life.</s>
