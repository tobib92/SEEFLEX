        <salute>Hey John,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>How are you?</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Thank you for your email.</s>
        <s>Since you asked if a school without can really exist, I want to help you and try to answer this <choice><orig>intressting</orig><reg>interesting</reg></choice> question.</s>
        <s>So I found an article about the label <name type="misc">School without racism, school with <choice><orig>courrag</orig><reg>courage</reg></choice></name>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>More than 3000 schools have that label.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>That article says, that there is no school without racism.</s>
        <s>There are just schools, which engange against racism.</s>
        <s>It has been proved that students of color get worse grades, than the other students.</s>
        <s>Evidence has been found in the study <name type="misc">Max versus Murat</name>.</s>
        <s>Although <name type="misc">Max</name> and <name type="misc">Murat</name> made the same mistakes, <name type="misc">Max</name> got a better grade.</s>
        <s>Furthermore students are way <choice><orig>to</orig><reg>too</reg></choice> less educated in everyday racism.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>You surely asked yourself how we can fight against all that discrimination.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The most important thing is not to deny that racism is a big problem is our <choice><orig>todays</orig><reg>today's</reg></choice> society.</s>
        <s>Furthermore teachers often do not realize that what they are saying is racist.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Where does the racism come from?</s>
        <s>Mostly from <choice><orig>childrens</orig><reg>children's</reg></choice> books, immigrants are often presented as the big, bad and angry kid.</s>
        <s>That's why kids have racist ideas.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope that my answer could help you and that it was <choice><orig>intresting</orig><reg>interesting</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>See you soon at the <name type="misc"><choice><abbr>FWG</abbr><expan>Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium</expan></choice></name></s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Take care,</s>
