        <s>how are you doing?</s>

        <s>Yesterday I found a great article, published on <name type="misc">Spiegel Online</name>, about three young people that experienced the life as seamstress for one day in <name type="geo"><choice><orig>Kambodscha</orig><reg>Cambodia</reg></choice></name>.</s>
        <s>It was shocking for them how hard they had to work on working circumstances that are <choice><orig>unbelieveable</orig><reg>unbelievable</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>They realized that these people are only poor because the money is not distribute.</s>
        <s>Maybe you will understand more that the globalisation has winners but also losers.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Hopefully we see each other again soon.</s>
