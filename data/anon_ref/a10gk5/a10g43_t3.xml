        <s>Are we humans responsible for environmental pollution?</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Yes, we are.</s>
        <s>I know, that was a clear statement, but <choice><orig>its</orig><reg>it's</reg></choice> the only possible answer.</s>
        <s>Everyone, who disagrees with that statement is either just joking or has to look around himself.</s>

      <p>
        <s>Every day we hear of and see the effects of pollution on humans as well as on other living <choice><orig>beeings</orig><reg>beings</reg></choice>, in the news, we drink contaminated water, we eat contaminated vegetables.</s>
        <s>But, as well as we <choice><orig>cant</orig><reg>can't</reg></choice> go on like this, we can't just step back and destroy all our <choice><orig>achievments</orig><reg>achievements</reg></choice>, because being a human means: <choice><orig>Developtment</orig><reg>Development</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>So, we have to use all those incredible <choice><orig>achievments</orig><reg>achievements</reg></choice> to stop environmental pollution.</s>
        <s>We create those technologies and machines to make our life better, but to have a better life we have to survive.</s>
        <s>And we won't, if we go on like this.</s>
        <s>Why don't we use more e-cars or trains for travelling - because they aren't cheap.</s>
        <s>But money shouldn't stop us from improving our <choice><orig>lifes</orig><reg>lives</reg></choice>.</s>
