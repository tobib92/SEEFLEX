        <s>So, she was trying to persuade me to kill <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Duncan</ref>.</s>
        <s>I think she forgot, that <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Duncan</ref> is actual a king.</s>
        <s>You can't kill a king that easily, she described.</s>
        <s>My husband thinks, she can drunk two of <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">Duncan's</ref> guards, but there are many more of this, not only those.</s>
        <s>This is one obstacle.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The second point, why I think, I shouldn't kill the <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">King Duncan</ref> is, that the prophecy even says I will become king, also when I don't kill him.</s>
        <s>So I'm convinced, that I become a great <choice><orig>king</orig><reg>King</reg></choice> of <name type="geo"><choice><orig>scotland</orig><reg>Scotland</reg></choice></name> on a legal and right way.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>But imagine my husband's plan will work and I will kill <ref target="c12gk3_1" type="character">King Duncan</ref> on <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> very brutal and violently way.</s>
        <s>Everyone in the society will hate me and no one will accept me as the new <choice><orig>king</orig><reg>King</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Furthermore I will lose my high reputation.</s>
        <s>I know, I'm a really and honest man, if I become king on a legal way and I trust the prophecy.</s>
