        <s>Hello, my name is <name type="person">Faraj al-Byarshan</name>.</s>
        <s>I'm 41, <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> engineer and <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> immigrated to <name type="geo">New York</name> from <name type="geo">Iraq</name> in <date>2005</date>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I'm happy to be here now, but it was a very hard way to get, where I am now.</s>
        <s>My wife and my two sons followed me two years later, in <date>2007</date>.</s>
        <s>I was very scared, they wouldn't make it but I'm really proud of them.</s>
        <s>We emigrated because in our country were much <choice><orig>poevrety</orig><reg>poverty</reg></choice>, school exclusions and criminality.</s>
        <s>I wanted a better life for my kids and earn money.</s>
        <s>To be here is very nice but often we get in contact with racism.</s>
        <s>I think people will always look at us <choice><orig>differen</orig><reg>different</reg></choice>, just because we are black.</s>
        <s>But I'm very happy to be here after such a long journey.</s>
        <s>I was always scared that my kids and my wife get killed and I couldn't protect them.</s>
        <s>Now we can <choice><orig>life</orig><reg>live</reg></choice> in peace and freedom.</s>
        <s>My children are going to school and I earn money so I can say we got a nice life.</s>
        <s>Sure, we miss our home country at some <choice><orig>way's</orig><reg>ways</reg></choice>, but it's also very hard to get okay with the flashbacks you get, when for example somebody got shooted <choice><orig>infront</orig><reg>in front</reg></choice> of your eyes.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think, now in <name type="geo">New York</name> we found our place and get a <choice><orig>save</orig><reg>safe</reg></choice> life.</s>
