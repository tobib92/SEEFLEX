        <s><choice><orig>today</orig><reg>Today</reg></choice> I read your speech from <date>November 2021</date> at the <name type="misc">COP26</name>.</s>
        <s>You have figured out the situation and <choice><orig>understanded</orig><reg>understood</reg></choice> the importance of fighting the climate change and although I not agree with most ofyour politics I was impressed how you pointed out your position that clear and showed that ayou had a right view about the topic.</s>
        <s>But as your know your speech wasn't more than <quote>blah blah blah</quote> too, it makes me sad to say that.</s>
        <s>Because of the fact that you didn't enough the life of my whole generation is so much worse than yours, and that's your fault.</s>
        <s>You are not <name type="person">James Bond</name>.</s>
        <s>It feels so unreal that you have even said that.</s>
