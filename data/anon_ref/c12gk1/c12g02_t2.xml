        <s>In line 5 <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> uses an exaggeration to underline his sentence: <quote>It is an ever-fixed mark</quote>.</s>
        <s>With this short part he <choice><orig>want</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> to get the full interest of the reader/listener and <choice><orig>want</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> that they think about his idea.</s>
        <s>Furthermore he compares the ever-fixed mark (the changes) with the star to every wandering ship <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 5/l. 7)</ref>.</s>

        <s>He writes about that <quote>his height get be taken</quote>.</s>
        <s>The height to be taken means to calculate the distance.</s>
        <s>I think <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> <choice><orig>want</orig><reg>wants</reg></choice> that the reader or listener think about the value of his partner, because not everybody realized it yet.</s>

        <s>I think <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare's</ref> intention, why he has written the <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="title">Sonnet 116</ref>, is that he want to show the importance from love.</s>

        <s><ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> thinks that a strong love will hold for the rest of your life.</s>
        <s>So love will not get older because of hours and weeks.</s>

        <s>To put it in a netshell you can say that the <choice><orig>massages</orig><reg>messages</reg></choice> of the sonnet are <choice><orig>cleare</orig><reg>clear</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>I think the message is good <choice><orig>choosen</orig><reg>chosen</reg></choice> from <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> and the sonnet is structured very well.</s>
