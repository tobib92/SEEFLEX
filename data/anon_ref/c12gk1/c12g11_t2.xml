        <s>The poet works with similies.</s>
        <s>He compares the love as <quote>wandering bark</quote> <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(l .7)</ref>, or a never shaken tempest <ref target="c12gk1_1" type="line">(<foreign xml:lang="de">vgl.</foreign> l. 6)</ref>.</s>

        <s>How I metioned earlier in my analyses is the love described as <quote>ever-fixed mark</quote>.</s>
