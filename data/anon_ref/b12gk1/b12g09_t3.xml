        <salute>Dear Mr.Johnson,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Today I saw your speech from back in <date>2021</date> and it really showed me why we are in our current situation.</s>
        <s>I think your speech hit the spot in the audience and inspired all to put double the effort into the summit.</s>
        <s>So that today we <choice><orig>life</orig><reg>live</reg></choice> in a more ecological society and any form of guilt was extinguished in its beginnings.</s>
        <s>In fact now all billions of the new generations are in the debt of your actions an the actions of all other world leaders all around the globe and managed to turn the tide.</s>
        <s>All bit the bullet to spare as much CO2 emissions as possible.</s>
        <s>Thanks to <name type="misc">COP26</name> we are now in the position of evading the guilt by finishing your projects and sustaining them in the future.</s>
        <s>I hope that you are as proud as we are of what has been <choice><orig>acomplished</orig><reg>accomplished</reg></choice> in the last few decades ust because of this one moment in history written in <name type="geo">Glasgow</name>.</s>
        <s>I hope you are enjoying your retirement and will get to see what we build on your foundation.</s>
      </p>
