        <s>He welcomes them twice by using a parallelism <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 1)</ref> to connect the following metaphor about <name type="person">James Bond</name> to the beginning and <name type="geo">Glasgow</name>, where the climate summit takes place.</s>
        <s><ref target="b12gk1_1" type="speaker">Boris Johnson</ref> compares the <name type="person">James Bond</name> movies and the <quote>doomsday device</quote> <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 3)</ref> in it to the actual situation with the climate change right now <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 2-8)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The Second part is a look back into the past and what <choice><orig>happend</orig><reg>happened</reg></choice> before <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 10-15)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>This paragraph is showing the history of the fight against climate change: first the acknowledgment <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 10)</ref>, then the promises the <choice><orig>politians</orig><reg>politicians</reg></choice> did not keep, which are <choice><orig>critizised</orig><reg>criticised</reg></choice> by <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="speaker">Johnson</ref>, who is making fun of them by using <quote>blah, blah, blah</quote> <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 13)</ref>, and at last the present, where they have the opportunity to do something and have to do something <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 14f.)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The third part <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 16f.)</ref> is short and is there to give hope (<quote>we can</quote> <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 6)</ref>).</s>
        <s><ref target="b12gk1_1" type="speaker">Johnson</ref> uses a <choice><orig>anumeration</orig><reg>enumeration</reg></choice> <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 16)</ref> to show what they are capable of and he is also referring back to the beginning by using again the metaphor with the <quote>doomsday device</quote> <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 16f.)</ref>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the next part <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 18-21)</ref> he shows that the industrial countries are responsible to save the earth because they are guilty <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 19)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In the following part <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 22-29)</ref> he presents his idea to integrate the economy to the plans.</s>
        <s>To convince his audience he starts this part with a repetition of <quote>not</quote> <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 22)</ref> to show that the <choice><orig>governement</orig><reg>government</reg></choice> <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> solve this problem alone.</s>
        <s>At the end of this part he gives an example where the <name type="geo">UK</name> changed their <choice><orig>energie</orig><reg>energy</reg></choice> sources because of the private sector <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 28f.)</ref>.</s>
        <s>He uses this example to prove the <choice><orig>effectivness</orig><reg>effectiveness</reg></choice> of his idea.</s>

        <s>After that introduction of the problematic between the generations, <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="speaker">Johnson</ref> looks in the next part to the younger generations <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 38-44)</ref>.</s>
        <s>He starts in line 37 to repeat the word <quote>children</quote> four times, he does this to let the politicians focus on the young generations and their <choice><orig>judgement</orig><reg>judgment</reg></choice> <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 38, 42)</ref>.</s>
        <s>At the end of this paragraph he uses the metaphor <quote>end of the story</quote> <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 43)</ref> to express the urgency to act.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The next part <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 45-47)</ref> shall motivate the audience to make concrete plans, so do the parallelism and the <choice><orig>anumeration</orig><reg>enumeration</reg></choice> in line 46 and 47.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the last part <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 48-52)</ref> he refers back to the beginning and the <name type="person">James Bond</name> metaphor <ref target="b12gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 48, 50 <quote>bomb</quote>)</ref>.</s>
        <s>In line 48 he uses irony to make the audience laugh and stop the tightening.</s>

      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion we have to say he wants the audience to feel <choice><orig>speacial</orig><reg>special</reg></choice> by comparing them to <name type="person">James Bond</name> but also wants to make them understand that they have to decide for the following generations.</s>
