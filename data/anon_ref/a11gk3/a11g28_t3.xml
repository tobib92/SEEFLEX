        <salute>Dear Mr. Rump,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I am Erwin's friend from <name type="geo">Germany</name> and I am writing to you, because I heard that the novel <name type="misc">The Hate U Give</name> was banned in the district of your school.</s>
        <s>I am sure you have heard about the reasoning behind it as well.</s>
        <s>I understand that it contains content not appropriate for younger students, but I don't see that as a reason enough to ban it.</s>
        <s>Especially older students need to be educated on the discrimination in the country they live in and the not so pretty and harsh reality existing.</s>
        <s>The novel empowers people to speak up and try to make a change in society, so that people do not have to take drugs and do criminal activities, which is exactly what they don't approve.</s>
