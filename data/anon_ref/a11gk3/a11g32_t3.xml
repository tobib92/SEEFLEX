        <salute>Dear Mr. Rump,</salute>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I think it's wrong to ban the book <name type="misc">The Hate U Give</name> from your school libraries and I will try to convince you too.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s><choice><orig>Im</orig><reg>In</reg></choice> my opinion this book shows a different view to most of your students, towards racism and equality.</s>
        <s>By reading the book and maybe also speaking about it, you can get your students more empathic, towards the topic racism.</s>
        <s>So for example, when somebody is treated unfair they can understand and support them.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>It's important to let them face situations and feelings, that many <choice><orig>afro american</orig><reg>Afro-American</reg></choice> people share.</s>
        <s>They and every student in the world should know and understand that there are still <choice><orig>opresses</orig><reg>oppressed</reg></choice> people in society.</s>
        <s>So that maybe future generations have fewer prejudices and make the world a fair and better place for everyone.</s>
      </p>
