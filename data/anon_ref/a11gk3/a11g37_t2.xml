        <s>And because of the first-person the reader can feel the pain from <ref target="a11gk3_1" type="character">Starr</ref>.</s>
        <s>Maybe it feels like that you were on <ref target="a11gk3_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> position when <ref target="a11gk3_1" type="character">Khalil</ref> was shot and you were <choice><orig>ther</orig><reg>there</reg></choice> to see this.</s>
