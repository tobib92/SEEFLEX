        <s>The scene, I'll analyze, takes place in the mainly white <choice><orig>Higschool</orig><reg>highschool</reg></choice> of the protagonist <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref>.</s>
        <s>We get our first impression of <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> boyfriend <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> and the dynamic between him and <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref>.</s>
        <s>The scene is one of the first scenes in the movie and comes right after the murder of <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character"><choice><orig>Starrs</orig><reg>Starr's</reg></choice></ref> friend <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Khalil</ref> by a police officer, while they drove away from and kissed each other, <choice><orig>althoug</orig><reg>although</reg></choice> <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> has already <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> as a boyfriend.</s>

        <s>After this he arrives <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref>, who stands at her locker and puts his earphones on her head.</s>
        <s>We can hear a beat which is, as <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> says, his own and <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Starr</ref> tells in a funny way that <ref target="b10gk5_1" type="character">Chris</ref> thinks, he's <name type="person">DJ Khalid</name>.</s>
