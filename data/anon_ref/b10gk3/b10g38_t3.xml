        <s>The novel <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="title">The Hate U Give</ref>, written by <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="director">George Tillmann Jr.</ref> has difference between the book and the film.</s>
        <s>One thing is that in this scene <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> is fighting with <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">King</ref> but in the book he is arguing with <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Mr. Lewis</ref>.</s>
        <s>Another thing is that in the movie he is eating dinner with his family but in the book he is working in his store.</s>
        <s>The exact purpose of the scene is that police violence is really bad and also brutally.</s>
        <s>In the film is this aspect more shown because you can see the facial expression of the character.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>One thing which is really suspicious as I said at the beginning is that though one of the police officers is black he treats <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref> very brutally.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>All in all I would say that the film is better than the novel.</s>
