        <s>In my opinion the scene of the movie isn't faithful enough because in the novel, which is written by <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="author">Angie Thomas</ref>, the skin colour of the police officers is underlined more than in the movie.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In the novel you also got to see stereotypes of <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="character">Maverick</ref>, which the officers used without awareness.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>But in the movie stereotypes weren't as much as in the novel.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The purpose of <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="author">Angie Thomas</ref> in the novel's sequence also was to show that we have to stop thinking stereotypical, but in the movie it seemed like <ref target="b10gk3_1" type="director">George Tillmann Jr.</ref> hadn't the purpose to do that.</s>
