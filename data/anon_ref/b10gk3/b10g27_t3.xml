        <s>From my point of view the movie's version is still faithful enough to the novel's idea or purpose, since the main purpose of both is to show the police brutality against the black community, so the differences between the novel and the movie, for example where it takes place or who is having the conflict in the beginning don't really matter, the main thing is that both of the scenes have the same purpose.</s>
