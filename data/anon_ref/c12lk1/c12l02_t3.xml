        <s>As I have learned about various sonnets of <ref target="c12lk1_1" type="author">Shakespeare</ref> I am able to say that his <ref target="c12lk1_1" type="title">Sonnet 65</ref> fits absolutely in his time.</s>

        <s>He was very talented in writing, because he had the <choice><orig>tallend</orig><reg>talent</reg></choice> to impress emotions very well and people seemed to be connected to his words.</s>
        <s>He touched to souls of the people with his special words and language he is using.</s>

      <p>
        <s>In addition his sonnets are always affressed to someone.</s>
        <s>In this sonnet he writes to the <quote>Youth</quote>.</s>
        <s>This is the first sign that this poetry fits into his time.</s>

      </p>
      <p>
