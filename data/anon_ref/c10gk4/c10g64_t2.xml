        <s>Do you remember your opinion on students exchanges?</s>
        <s>You once told me that you think student exchanges are a waste of time and I would like to tell you my opinion.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In my opinion student exchanges are not a <choice><orig>wast</orig><reg>waste</reg></choice> of time.</s>
        <s>First of all you can see another country where you maybe work later and get some experience by making friends and talking to the people.</s>
        <s>Another point is that you will learn a new language or increase your language skills in another way than by a teacher or the internet.</s>
        <s>As a final point it will look good on an application if you <choice><orig>traveled</orig><reg>travelled</reg></choice> and lived in another country, because you may have to travel a lot in your future job.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I hope that I could change your opinion and maybe we will once study abroad together.</s>
