        <s>At the end he speaks directly to the listeners by using the pronouns <quote>you</quote>, so that they listen more carefully and feel involved in the speech.</s>
        <s>With the sentence <quote>That's always been a critical part of how America engages the world</quote> <ref target="c10gk4_1" type="line">(l. 11)</ref>, he shows that it is not only his interest but from the <name type="geo">United States of America</name>.</s>
