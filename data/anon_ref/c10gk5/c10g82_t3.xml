        <s><quote>The limits of my language are the limits of my world</quote> is a quote by <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name>, which I am going to comment on.</s>

        <s>Especially in a globalized world, being multilingual is essetial.</s>
        <s>Jobs, media, everyday language - other languages, especially English, are ever-present.</s>
        <s>If you only speak your native language, you might get left behind in the modern world.</s>
        <s>A good example of that is one of my family members complaining about not being able to read commercials because they contain English words.</s>
        <s>This might not be a huge problem, but it shows how big of a role other languages play in our lives nontheless.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In conclusion: I agree with <name type="person">Wittgenstein</name>.</s>
        <s>Especially nowadays, not knowing other languages really does limit your horizon, even if you do not want to travel.</s>
        <s>Other cultures and languages are a part of ours.</s>
