        <s>The informative text <ref target="c10gk5_1" type="title">Hope of escape lost in translation</ref> written by <ref target="c10gk5_1" type="author">Zia Haider Rahman</ref> is about the big translating problem and the British residents.</s>

        <s>In my opinion I would support the opinion from the author because many people will only translate things and don't want to learn the language and that can be a big problem in the world.</s>
        <s>I also think and this is my biggest argument that it would be very expensive over the years and if everyone only <choice><orig>use</orig><reg>uses</reg></choice> the translating it will be so expensive for the people and they don't learn new things they just have to google for example a line and then they got their <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> translating.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So because of the many arguments against <choice><orig>i</orig><reg>I</reg></choice> wouldn't support this.</s>
        <s>The metaphor from <name type="person">Ludwig Wittgenstein</name> is also very right.</s>
        <s>He means that you can reach so much in world how you can speak so you can speak <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> you can of course make a year abroad in the <name type="geo">US</name> for example.</s>
        <s>If you can speak African you can make e.g. a safari out there.</s>

        <s>The <choice><orig>philosoph</orig><reg>philosopher</reg></choice> is right and I support his view.</s>
