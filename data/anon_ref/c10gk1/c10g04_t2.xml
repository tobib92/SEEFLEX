        <s>At first they talk about a few informative facts about <name type="geo">Britain</name> that more than Â£100<choice><abbr>m</abbr><expan>million</expan></choice> got spent on translating and <choice><orig>interpretting</orig><reg>interpreting</reg></choice> things for people who cannot speak or <choice><orig>has</orig><reg>have</reg></choice> not learned <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>.</s>

        <s>After that the author tells us about their own experienced and that they and their parents started learning <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> to integrate in the <q><choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice></q> community.</s>
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        <s>To support the <choice><orig>authors</orig><reg>author's</reg></choice> message there were used some stylistic devices.</s>

      <p>
        <s>Overall the language <choice><orig>wich</orig><reg>which</reg></choice> is used is in between formal and informal but I would rather say more formal because the author puts a lot of <choice><orig>informations</orig><reg>information</reg></choice> in their text but on the other hand it is not hard to understand.</s>
