        <s>The author tries to convince the reader in several ways, for example using the structure of the text.</s>
        <s>It is split into four about equally long parts: An introduction, containing <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice> statement and example, and then an example, to prove the statement in the introduction.</s>
        <s>The third part contains firstly <choice><orig>te</orig><reg>the</reg></choice> example for a statement and argument which then is found later in the same part.</s>
        <s>The last part expands the <choice><orig>statent</orig><reg>statement</reg></choice> from the third, making it the other main topic of the text.</s>
        <s>Overall, it is very different from other argumentative texts.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>The example at the beginning sets the <choice><orig>readers</orig><reg>reader's</reg></choice> mind and influences them.</s>
        <s>The example in the second part helps the reader understand the situation and makes it seem dangerous.</s>
        <s>The positive example in the third part explains how it should be, but also claims it is the <choice><orig>migrants</orig><reg>migrants'</reg></choice> fault they aren't educated.</s>
        <s>This information is easy to receive, <choice><orig>altough</orig><reg>although</reg></choice> not directly mentioned in the text, which makes the reader think it is their own conclusion and as such more reliable.</s>
        <s>Only in the last part, the author states his true intention, even though he has no examples nor <choice><orig>prove</orig><reg>proof</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>The first three parts are <choice><orig>reall</orig><reg>really</reg></choice> working together to create this assumption, and because there were examples and facts in it, the reader thinks the statement is also proved.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Another device to influence the reader are stylistic devices.</s>
        <s>One of them is the comparison between 100m and the signals for integration <ref target="c10gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 1-3)</ref>.</s>
        <s>By saying it is worse than 100000000 pounds, the reader has an idea of how big the problem is even though he has no information yet.</s>
        <s>Another one is the repetition of sentences starting with <quote>My parents</quote> <ref target="c10gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 11-14)</ref>.</s>
        <s>It expresses how important the parents are.</s>
        <s>They are also synonym for all refugees which should try to learn <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>The repetition and importance also supports the important role of the parents or refugees in the process, as I stated in the structure analysis.</s>
        <s>A third stylistic device is the personification of the problem <ref target="c10gk1_1" type="line">(ll. 18-19)</ref>, which makes the problem more understandable for readers who haven't got it yet.</s>
