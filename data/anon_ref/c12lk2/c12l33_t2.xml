        <s>While time for a human is finite for nature it is infinite and <choice><orig>natures</orig><reg>nature's</reg></choice> beauty does not fade throughout time in contrast to the beauty of a person, which indeed fades as the years go by.</s>

        <s>Since it is <ref target="c12lk2_1" type="author"><choice><orig>Shakespears</orig><reg>Shakespeare's</reg></choice></ref> 60th sonnet it is most likely <choice><orig>adressed</orig><reg>addressed</reg></choice> to a young man which he holds very near ad dear to his heart.</s>

        <s>The author metaphorically calls the state of maturing as <quote>being crowned</quote> <ref target="c12lk2_1" type="line">(l. 6)</ref> which shows that he thinks that once a human is grown-up he is at the height of his life.</s>
