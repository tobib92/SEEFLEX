        <s>Today I will komment on the statement of <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="author">John Worne</ref> that <q>language learning is vital for the <name type="geo">UK's</name> future prosperity and global standing</q>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I agree with him because language is the key to globalisation and helps everyone to communicate with each other.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>But I think that language learning isn't vital for the <name type="geo">UK's</name> future but for the future of every country because we used to communicate with each other.</s>
        <s>For example not everyone in Africa or other developing countries speaks <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>So to communicate with them we need someone who knows their language.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Otherwise we can't communicate with each other.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In his article <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="author">Worne</ref> declines that everyone in business speaks <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice> <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="line">(l. 13)</ref> but I think that nearly everyone who is involved in world business has to speak or understand <choice><orig>english</orig><reg>English</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>Furthermore I think that language is important for the prosperity because as <ref target="a12gk1_1" type="author">Worne</ref> mentioned a person with foreign language skills is more in demand <choice><orig>then</orig><reg>than</reg></choice> someone without this skill.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>To conclude I think that language learning is very important for the future of the <name type="geo">UK</name> and every other <choice><orig>countrie</orig><reg>country</reg></choice> and for the globalisation.</s>
