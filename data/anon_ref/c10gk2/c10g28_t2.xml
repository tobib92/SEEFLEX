        <s>As stated in the summary <choice><orig>president</orig><reg>President</reg></choice> <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Barack Obama</ref> gave a speech dealing with the importance of intercultural understanding and student <choice><orig>exchang</orig><reg>exchange</reg></choice>.</s>
        <s>Following to this I'm going to analyse <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> structure and choice of words.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>In order to encourage his listeners to taking part in intercultural exchanges <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> divides his speech chronologically in four paragraphs.</s>
        <s>In three of these sections can be founded a climax.</s>
        <s>While he first talks about <name type="geo"><choice><orig>Americas</orig><reg>America's</reg></choice></name> view to the topic <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 4-11)</ref> he secondly speaks about the world's view <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 13-17)</ref> and lastly about individuals <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(ll. 18-22)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Concerning the choice of words <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> uses an everyday register which helps to connect with the young audience <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(cf. ll. 21-22)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Many ideagraphs are also used during his speech with words like <quote>idealism</quote> e.g. <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="line">(l. 6)</ref>.</s>
        <s>Regarding the effect this creates a sense of identity.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Moreover, one can find multiple stylistic devices as a metaphor in line 13.</s>
        <s><quote>Break down walls</quote> helps to visualise the meaning of losing our differences in this case.</s>

      <p>
        <s>Parallelism is <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>an</reg></choice> often used stylistic devices by <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> as in lines 18-20 which helps to emphasise the idea of <choice><orig>chosing</orig><reg>choosing</reg></choice> and building your own future.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Nevertheless, <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> is using a direct <choice><orig>adress</orig><reg>address</reg></choice> as <quote>us</quote> in line 13 which is including us and creates a relationship to the audience.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>Summing up one can say that <ref target="c10gk2_1" type="speaker">Obama</ref> gave a <choice><orig>conving</orig><reg>convincing</reg></choice> speech about intercultural exchanges by using a clear and effective structure such as including a variety of stylistic devices and an optimal choice of words.</s>
